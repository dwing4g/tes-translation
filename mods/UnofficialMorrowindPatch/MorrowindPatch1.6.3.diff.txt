I dreamt of a blond maiden. I drew near, and saw she was crying, but her tears were red as blood. I touched her tears and tasted them, and they were wonderfully salty, sharp with spice and savor. But the maiden's face had changed, her skin grey-white, and red tears dripped from her lips, and her hair had turned black, and wreathed her head like twining snakes. I was afraid, but could not run. I screamed, and then I woke, heart pounding, cramped and aching.

Following the Battle of Ichidag, the Emperor Uriel Septim III was captured and, before he was able to be brought to his uncle's castle in the Hammerfell kingdom of Gilane, he met his death at the hands of an angry mob.  This uncle, Cephorus, was thereafter proclaimed emperor and rode to the Imperial City.  The troops formerly loyal to Emperor Uriel and his mother, the Wolf Queen Potema, pledged themselves to the new Emperor.  In return for their support, the nobility of Skyrim, High Rock, Hammerfell, the Summerset Isle, Valenwood, Black Marsh, and Morrowind demanded and received a new level of autonomy and independence from the Empire.  The War of the Red Diamond was at an end.<BR>
<BR>
Potema continued to fight a losing battle, her area of influence dwindling and dwindling until only her kingdom of Solitude remained in her power. She summoned daedra to fight for her, had her necromancers resurrect her fallen enemies as undead warriors, and mounted attack after attack on the forces of her brothers, the Emperor Cephorus Septim I and King Magnus of Lilmoth.  Her allies began leaving her as her madness grew, and her only companions were the zombies and skeletons she had amassed over the years.  The kingdom of Solitude became a land of death.  Stories of the ancient Wolf Queen being waited on by rotting skeletal chambermaids and holding war plans with vampiric generals terrified her subjects.<BR>

Magnus opened up the small window in his room.  For the first time in weeks, he heard the sounds of a city: carts squeaking, horses clopping over the cobblestones, and somewhere a child laughing.  He smiled as he returned to his bedside to wash his face and finish dressing.  There was a distinctive knock on the door.<BR>
<BR>
$93Come in, Pel,$94 he said.<BR>
<BR>
Pelagius bounded into the room.  It was obvious that he had been up for hours.  Magnus marveled at his energy, and wondered how much longer battles would last if they were run by twelve-year-old boys.<BR>
<BR>
$93Did you see outside yet?$94 Pelagius asked. $93All the townspeople have come back!  There are shops, and a Mages Guild, and down by the harbor, I saw a hundred shops come in from all over the place!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93They don't have to be afraid anymore.  We've taken care of all the zombies and ghosts that used to be their neighbors, and they know it's safe to come back.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Is Uncle Cephorus going to turn into a zombie when he dies?$94 asked Pelagius.<BR>
<BR>
$93I wouldn't put that past him,$94 laughed Magnus. $93Why do you ask?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I heard some people saying that he was old and sick,$94 said Pelagius.<BR>
<BR>
$93He's not that old,$94 said Magnus. $93He's sixty years old.  That's just two years older than I.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93And how old is Aunt Potema?$94 asked Pelagius.<BR>
<BR>
$93Seventy,$94 said Magnus. $93And yes, that is old.  Any more questions will have to wait.  I have to go meet with the commander now, but we can talk at supper.  You can make yourself busy, and not get into any trouble?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, sir,$94 said Pelagius.  He understood that his father had to continue to hold siege on aunt Potema's castle.  After they took it over and locked her up, they would move out of the inn and into the castle.  Pelagius was not looking forward to that.  The whole town had a funny, sweet, dead smell, but he could not get even as close as the castle moat without gagging from the stench.  They could dump a million flowers on the place and it wouldn't make any difference at all.<BR>
<BR>
He walked through the city for hours, buying some food and then some ribbons for his sister and mother back in Lilmoth.  He thought about who else he needed to buy gifts for and was stumped.  All his cousins, the children of Uncle Cephorus, Uncle Antiochus, and Aunt Potema, had died during the war, some of them in battle and some of them during the famines because so many crops had been burned.  Aunt Bianki had died last year.  There was only he, his mother, his sister, his father, and his uncle the Emperor left.  And Aunt Potema.  But she didn't really count.<BR>
<BR>
When he came upon the Mages Guild earlier that morning, he had decided not to go in.  Those places always spooked him with their strange smoke and crystals and old books.  This time, it occurred to Pelagius that he might buy a gift for Uncle Cephorus.  A souvenir of Solitude's Mages Guild.<BR>
<BR>
An old woman was having trouble with the front door, so Pelagius opened it for her.<BR>
<BR>
$93Thank you,$94 she said.<BR>
<BR>
She was easily the oldest thing he had ever seen.  Her face looked like an old rotted apple framed with a wild whirl of bright white hair.  He instinctively moved away from her gnarled talon when she started to pat him on the head.  But there was a gem around her neck that immediately fascinated him.  It was a single bright yellow jewel, but it almost looked there was something trapped within.  When the light hit it from the candles, it brought out the form of a four-legged beast, pacing.<BR>
<BR>
$93It's a soul gem,$94 she said. $93Infused with the spirit of a great demon werewolf.  It was enchanted long, long ago with the power to charm people, but I've been thinking about giving it another spell.  Perhaps something from the School of Alteration like Lock or Shield.$94 She paused and looked at the boy carefully with yellowed, rheumy eyes. $93You look familiar to me, boy.  What's your name?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Pelagius,$94 he said.  He normally would have said $93Prince Pelagius,$94 but he was told not to draw attention to himself while in town.<BR>
<BR>
$93I used to know someone named Pelagius,$94 the old woman said, and slowly smiled. $93Are you here alone, Pelagius?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My father is... with the army, storming the castle.  But he'll be back when the walls have been breached.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Which I dare say won't take too much longer,$94 sighed the old woman. $93Nothing, no matter how well built, tends to last.  Are you buying something in the Mages Guild?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I wanted to buy a gift for my uncle,$94 said Pelagius. $93But I don't know if I have enough gold.$94<BR>
<BR>
The old woman left the boy to look over the wares while she went to the Guild enchanter.  He was a young Nord, ambitious, and new to the kingdom of Solitude.  It took little persuasion and a lot of gold to convince him to remove the charm spell from the soul gem and imbue it with a powerful curse, a slow poison that would drain wisdom from its wearer year by year until he or she lost all reason.  She also purchased a cheap ring of fire resistance.<BR>
<BR>
$93For your kindness to an old woman, I've bought you these,$94 she said, giving the boy the necklace and the ring. $93You can give the ring to your uncle, and tell him it has been enchanted with a levitation spell, so if ever he needs to leap from high places, it will protect him.  The soulgem is for you.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Thank you,$94 said the boy. $93But this is too kind of you.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Kindness has nothing to do with it,$94 she answered, quite honestly. $93You see, I was in the Hall of Records at the Imperial Palace once or twice, and I read about you in the foretellings of the Elder Scrolls.  You will be Emperor one day, my boy, the Emperor Pelagius Septim III, and with this soul gem to guide you, posterity will always remember you and your deeds.$94<BR>
<BR>
With those words, the old woman disappeared down an alley behind the Mages Guild.  Pelagius looked after her, but he did not think to search behind a heap of stones.  If he had, he would have found a tunnel under the city into the very heart of Castle Solitude.  And if he had found his way there, he would have found, past the shambling undead and the moldering remains of a once grand palace, the bedroom of the queen.<BR>
<BR>
In that bedroom, he would find the Wolf Queen of Solitude in repose, listening to the sounds of her castle collapsing.  And he would see a toothless grin growing on her face as she breathed her last.<BR>

The Horror of Castle Xyr<BR>
A One Act Play<BR>
by Baloth-Kul<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
Dramatis Personae<BR>
Clavides, Captain of the Imperial Guard.  Cyrodilic.<BR>
Anara, a Dunmer maid.<BR>
Ullis, a Lieutenant of the Imperial Guard.  Argonian.<BR>
Zollassa, a young Argonian mage<BR>
<BR>
Late evening.  The play opens in the interior Great Entrance Hall of a castle in Scath Anud, replete with fine furnishings and tapestries.  Torches provide the only illumination.  In the center of the foyer is a great iron door, the main entrance to the castle.  The staircase up to the landing above is next to this door.  On stage left is the door to the library, which is currently closed.  On stage right is a huge suit of armor, twenty feet tall, nearly touching the ceiling of the room.  Though no one can be seen, there is the sound of a woman singing coming from the library door.<BR>
<BR>
A loud thumping knock on the iron front door stops the woman's singing.  The door to the library opens and ANARA, a common-looking maid, comes out and hurries to open the front door.  CLAVIDES, a handsome man in Imperial garb stands there.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: Good evening to you, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Good evening.  Is your master at home?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: No, serjo, it's only me here.   My master Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr is at his winter estate.  Is there something I can do for you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Possibly.  Would you mind if I came in?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: Not at all, serjo.  Please.  May I offer you some flin?<BR>
<BR>
Clavides comes into the Hall and looks around.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  No thank you.  What's your name?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Anara, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Anara, when did your master leave Scath Anud?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  More than a fortnight ago.  That's why it's only me in the castle, serjo.  All the other servants and slaves who tend to his lordship travel with him.  Is there something wrong?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Yes, there is.  Do you know an ashlander by the name of Sul-Kharifa?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: No, serjo.  I don't know no one by that name.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Then you aren't likely to now.  He's dead.  He was found a few hours ago dying of frostbite in the ashlands.  He was hysterical, nearly incomprehensible, but among his last words were $93castle$94 and $93Xyr.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Dying of frostbite in summertide in the ashlands?  B'vek, that's strange.  I suppose it's possible that my master knew this man, but being an ashlander and my master being of the House of Telvanni, well, if you'll pardon me for being flippant, serjo, I don't think they coulda been friends.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  That is your master's library?  Would you mind if I looked in?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Please, serjo, go wherever you want.  We got nothing to hide.  We're loyal Imperial subjects.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: As, I hear, are all Telvanni.<BR>
<BR>
(Note from the playwright: this line should be delivered without sarcasm.  Trust the audience to laugh -- it never fails, regardless of the politics of the locals.)<BR>
<BR>
Clavides enters the library and looks over the books.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  The library needs dusting.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Yes, serjo.  I was just doing that when you knocked at the door.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I'm grateful for that.  If you had finished, I wouldn't notice the space in the dust where a rather large book has recently been removed.  Your master is a wizard, it seems.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  No, serjo.  I mean, he studies a lot, but he don't cast no spells, if that's what you mean by wizard.  He's a kena, went to college and everything.  You know, now that I think about it, I know what happened to that book.  One of the other kenas from the college been round yesterday, and borrowed a couple of books.  He's a friend of the master, so I thought it'd be all fine.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  This kena, was his name Warvim?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Coulda been.  I don't remember.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  There is a suspected necromancer at the college named Kena Warvim we arrested last night.  We don't know what he was doing at the college, but it was something illegal, that's for certain.  Was that the kena who borrowed the book?  A little fellow, a cripple with a withered leg?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  No, serjo, it weren't the kena from yesterday.  He was a big fella who could walk, so I noticed.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: I'm going to have a look around the rest of the house, if you don't mind.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides goes up the stairs, and delivers the following dialogue from the landing and the rooms above.  Anara continues straightening up the downstairs, moving a high-backed bench in front of the armor to scrub the floor.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Can I ask, serjo, what you're looking for?  Maybe I could help you.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Are these all the rooms in the castle?  No secret passages?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA (laughing):  Oh, serjo, what would Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr want with secret passages?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (looking at the armor):  Your master is a big man.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA (laughing):  Oh, serjo, don't tease.  That's giant armor, just for decoration.  My master slew that giant ten years ago, and kind of keeps it for a souvenir.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  That's right, I remember hearing something about that when I first took my post here.  It was someone named Xyr who killed the giant, but I didn't think the first name was Hordalf.  Memory fades I'm afraid.  What was the giant's name?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I'm afraid I don't remember, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I do.  It was Torfang.  $93I got out of Torfang's Shield.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I don't understand, serjo.  Torfang's shield?<BR>
<BR>
Clavides runs down the stairs, and examines the armor.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Sul-Kharifa said something about getting out of Torfang's shield.  I thought he was just raving, out of his mind.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  But he ain't got a shield, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides pushes the high-backed bench out of the way, revealing the large mounted shield at the base of the armor.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Yes, he does.  You covered it up with that bench.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I didn't do it on purpose, serjo!  I was just cleaning!  I see that armor ever day, serjo, and b'vek I swear I ain't never noticed the shield before!<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It's fine, Anara, I believe you.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides pushes on the shield and it pulls back to reveal a tunnel down.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It appears that Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr does have a need for a secret passage.  Could you get me a torch?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  B'vek, I ain't never seen that before!<BR>
<BR>
Anara takes a torch from the wall, and hands it to Clavides.  Clavides enters the tunnel.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Wait here.<BR>
<BR>
Anara watches Clavides disappear down the tunnel.  She appears agitated, and finally runs for the front door.  When she opens it, ULLIS, an Argonian lieutenant in the Imperial guard is standing at the entrance.  She screams.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  I'm sorry to frighten you.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Not now!  Go away!<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  I'm afraid the Captain wouldn't like that, miss.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  You're ... with the Captain?  Blessed mother.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides comes out of the tunnel, white-faced.  It takes him a few moments to speak.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Captain?  What's down there?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (to Anara):  Did you know your master's a necromancer?  That your cellar is filled with bodies?<BR>
<BR>
Anara faints.  Ullis carries her to the bench and lays her down.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Let me see, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  You'll see soon enough.  We're going to need every soldier from the post here to cart away all the corpses.  Ullis, I've seen enough battles, but I've never seen anything like this.  No two are alike.  Khajiiti, sload, dunmer, cyrodiil, breton, nord, burned alive, poisoned, electrified, melted, torn apart, turned inside out, ripped to shreds and sewn back up together.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  You think the ashlander escaped, that's what happened?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I don't know.  Why would someone do something like this, Ullis?<BR>
<BR>
There is a knock on the door.  Clavides answers it.  A young Argonian woman, ZOLLASSA, is standing, holding a package and a letter.<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Good morning, you're not Lord Xyr, are you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  No.  What do you have there?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  A letter and a package I'm supposed to deliver to him.  Will he be back shortly?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I don't believe so.  Who gave you the package to deliver?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  My teacher at the college, Kema Warvim.  He has a bad leg, so he asked me to bring these to his lordship.  Actually, to tell you the truth, I was supposed to deliver them last night, but I was busy.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Greetings, sistre.  We'll give the package to his lordship when we see him.<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Ah, hail, brothre.  I had heard there was a handsome Argonian in Scath Anud.  Unfortunately, I promised Kema Warvim that I'd deliver the package directly to his lordship's hands.  I'm already late, I can't just --<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  We're Imperial Guard, miss.  We will take the package and the letter.<BR>
<BR>
Zollassa reluctantly hands Clavides the letter and the package.  She turns to go.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  You're at the college, if we need to see you?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Yes.  Fare tidings, brothre.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Goodnight, sistre.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides opens the package as Zollassa exits.  It is a book with many loose sheets.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It appears we've found the missing book.  Delivered to our very hands.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides begins to read the book, silently to himself.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (to himself, very pleased):  Another Argonian in Scath Anud.  And a pretty one, at that.  I hope we weren't too rude to her.  I'm tired of all these women with their smooth, wet skin, it would be wonderful if we could meet when I'm off duty.  <BR>
<BR>
While Ullis talks, he opens the letter and reads it.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (continued):  She looks like she's from the south, like me.  You know, Argonians from northern Black Marsh are... much... less...<BR>
<BR>
Ullis continues reading, transfixed by the letter.  Clavides skips to the back of the book, and reads the last sentences.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (reading): In black ink $93The Khajiiti male showed surprisingly little fortitude to a simple lightning spell, but I've had interesting physiological results with a medium-level acid spell cast slowly over several days.$94  In red ink on the margins, $93Yes, I see.  Was the acid spell cast uniformly over the entire body of the subject?$94  In black ink $93The Nord female was subjected to sixteen hours of a frost spell which eventually crystalized her into a state of suspended animation, from which she eventually expired.  Not so the Nord male, nor the Ashlander male who lapsed into their comas much earlier, but then recovered.  The Ashlander then tried to escape, but I restrained him.  The Nord then had an interesting chemical overreaction to a simple fire spell and expired.  See the accompanying illustration.$94  In red ink, $93Yes, I see.  The pattern of boils and lesions suggest some sort of internal incineration perhaps caused by the combination of a short burst of flame following a longer session with frost.  It's such a shame I can't come to see the experiment personally, but I compliment you on your excellent notation.$94  In black ink, $93Thank you for the suggestion about slowly poisoning my maid Anara.  The dosages you've suggested have had fascinating results, eroding her memory very subtly.  I intend to increase it expotentially and see how long it is before she notices.  Speaking of which, it is a pity that I haven't any Argonian subjects, but the slave-traders promise me some healthy specimens in the autumn.  I should like to test their metabolism in comparison to elves and humans.  It's my theory that a medium-level lightning spell cast in a continuous wave on an Argonian wouldn't be lethal for several hours at least, similiar to my results with the Cyrodilic female and, of course, the giant.$94  In red ink, $93It'd be a shame to wait until autumn to see.$94<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (reading the letter):  In red ink, $93Here is your Argonian.  Please let me know the results.$94  It's signed $93Kema Warvim.$94<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  By Kynareth, this isn't necromancy.  It's Destruction.  Kema Warvim and Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr haven't been experimenting with death, but with the limits of magical torture.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  The letter isn't addressed to Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr.  It's addressed to Sedura Iachilla Xyr.  His wife, do you think?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Iachilla.  That was the Telvanni of the Xyr family who I heard about in connection with the giant slaying.  We'd best get the maid out of here.  She'll need to go to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides wakes up Anara.  She appears disoriented.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  What's happening?  Who are you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Don't worry, everything is going to be fine.  We're going to take you to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Do you need a coat, Iachilla?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Thank you, no, I'm not cold --<BR>
<BR>
Anara/Iachilla stops, realizing that she's been caught.  Clavides and Ullis unsheathe their blades.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  You have black ink on your fingers, your ladyship.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  And when you saw me at the door, you thought I was the Argonian your friend Warvim sent over.  That's why you said, $93Not now.  Go away.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA/IACHILLA:  You're much more observant than Anara.  She never did understand what was happening, even when I tripled the poison spell and she expired in what I observed as considerable agony.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  What were you going to use on me first, lightning or fire?<BR>
<BR>
ANANA/IACHILLA:  Lightning.  I find fire to be too unpredictable.<BR>
<BR>
As she speaks, the flames in the torchs extinguish.  The stage is utterly dark.<BR>
<BR>
There is the sound of a struggle, swords clanging.  Suddenly a bolt of lightning flashes out, and there is silence.  From the darkness, Anana/Iachilla speaks.<BR>
<BR>
ANANA/IACHILLA: Fascinating.<BR>
<BR>
There are several more flashes of lightning as the curtain closes.<BR>
<BR>
THE END.<BR>

CLAVIDES (to Anara):  Did you know your master's a necromancer?  That your cellar is filled with bodies?<BR>

<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I don't know.  Why would someone do something like this, Ullis?<BR>
<BR>
There is a knock on the door.  Clavides answers it.  A young Argonian woman, ZOLLASSA, is standing, holding a package and a letter.<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Good morning, you're not Lord Xyr, are you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  No.  What do you have there?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  A letter and a package I'm supposed to deliver to him.  Will he be back shortly?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I don't believe so.  Who gave you the package to deliver?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  My teacher at the college, Kema Warvim.  He has a bad leg, so he asked me to bring these to his lordship.  Actually, to tell you the truth, I was supposed to deliver them last night, but I was busy.<BR>

<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Yes.  Fare tidings, brothre.<BR>

ULLIS:  Goodnight, sistre.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides opens the package as Zollassa exits.  It is a book with many loose sheets.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It appears we've found the missing book.  Delivered to our very hands.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides begins to read the book, silently to himself.<BR>

While Ullis talks, he opens the letter and reads it.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (continued):  She looks like she's from the south, like me.  You know, Argonians from northern Black Marsh are... much... less...<BR>
<BR>
Ullis continues reading, transfixed by the letter.  Clavides skips to the back of the book, and reads the last sentences.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (reading): In black ink $93The Khajiiti male showed surprisingly little fortitude to a simple lightning spell, but I've had interesting physiological results with a medium-level acid spell cast slowly over several days.$94  In red ink on the margins, $93Yes, I see.  Was the acid spell cast uniformly over the entire body of the subject?$94  In black ink $93The Nord female was subjected to sixteen hours of a frost spell which eventually crystallized her into a state of suspended animation, from which she eventually expired.  Not so the Nord male, nor the Ashlander male who lapsed into their comas much earlier, but then recovered.  The Ashlander then tried to escape, but I restrained him.  The Nord then had an interesting chemical overreaction to a simple fire spell and expired.  See the accompanying illustration.$94  In red ink, $93Yes, I see.  The pattern of boils and lesions suggest some sort of internal incineration perhaps caused by the combination of a short burst of flame following a longer session with frost.  It's such a shame I can't come to see the experiment personally, but I compliment you on your excellent notation.$94  In black ink, $93Thank you for the suggestion about slowly poisoning my maid Anara.  The dosages you've suggested have had fascinating results, eroding her memory very subtly.  I intend to increase it exponentially and see how long it is before she notices.  Speaking of which, it is a pity that I haven't any Argonian subjects, but the slave-traders promise me some healthy specimens in the autumn.  I should like to test their metabolism in comparison to elves and humans.  It's my theory that a medium-level lightning spell cast in a continuous wave on an Argonian wouldn't be lethal for several hours at least, similiar to my results with the Cyrodilic female and, of course, the giant.$94  In red ink, $93It'd be a shame to wait until autumn to see.$94<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (reading the letter):  In red ink, $93Here is your Argonian.  Please let me know the results.$94  It's signed $93Kema Warvim.$94<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  By Kynareth, this isn't necromancy.  It's Destruction.  Kema Warvim and Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr haven't been experimenting with death, but with the limits of magical torture.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  The letter isn't addressed to Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr.  It's addressed to Sedura Iachilla Xyr.  His wife, do you think?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Iachilla.  That was the Telvanni of the Xyr family who I heard about in connection with the giant slaying.  We'd best get the maid out of here.  She'll need to go to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides wakes up Anara.  She appears disoriented.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  What's happening?  Who are you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Don't worry, everything is going to be fine.  We're going to take you to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Do you need a coat, Iachilla?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Thank you, no, I'm not cold --<BR>
<BR>
Anara/Iachilla stops, realizing that she's been caught.  Clavides and Ullis unsheathe their blades.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  You have black ink on your fingers, your ladyship.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  And when you saw me at the door, you thought I was the Argonian your friend Warvim sent over.  That's why you said, $93Not now.  Go away.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA/IACHILLA:  You're much more observant than Anara.  She never did understand what was happening, even when I tripled the poison spell and she expired in what I observed as considerable agony.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  What were you going to use on me first, lightning or fire?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA/IACHILLA:  Lightning.  I find fire to be too unpredictable.<BR>
<BR>
As she speaks, the flames in the torches extinguish.  The stage is utterly dark.<BR>
<BR>
There is the sound of a struggle, swords clanging.  Suddenly a bolt of lightning flashes out, and there is silence.  From the darkness, Anara/Iachilla speaks.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA/IACHILLA: Fascinating.<BR>
<BR>
There are several more flashes of lightning as the curtain closes.<BR>
<BR>
THE END.<BR>

Breathing Water<BR>
by Haliel Myrm<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
He walked through the dry, crowded streets of Bal Fell, glad to be among so many strangers.  In the wharfs of Vivec, he had no such anonymity.  They knew him to be a smuggler, but here, he could be anyone.  A lower-class peddler perhaps.  A student even.  Some people even pushed against him as he walked past as if to say, $93We would not dream of being so rude as to acknowledge that you don't belong here.$94<BR>
<BR>
Seryne Relas was not in any of the taverns, but he knew she was somewhere, perhaps behind a tenement window or poking around in a dunghill for an exotic ingredient for some spell or another.  He knew little of the ways of sorceresses, but that they always seemed to be doing something eccentric.  Because of this prejudice, he nearly passed by the old Dunmer woman having a drink from a well.  It was too prosaic, but he knew from the look of her that she was Seryne Relas, the great sorceress.<BR>
<BR>
$93I have gold for you,$94 he said to her back. $93If you will teach me the secret of breathing water.$94<BR>
<BR>
She turned around, a wide wet grin stretched across her weathered features. $93I ain't breathing it, boy.  I'm just having a drink.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Don't mock me,$94 he said, stiffly. $93Either you're Seryne Relas and you will teach me the spell of breathing water, or you aren't.  Those are the only possibilities.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93If you're going to learn to breath water, you're going to have to learn there are more possibilities than that, boy.   The School of Alteration is all about possibilities, changing patterns, making things be what they could be.  Maybe I ain't Seryne Relas, but I can teach how to breathe water,$94 she wiped her mouth dry. $93Or maybe I am Seryne Relas and I won't.  Or maybe even I can teach you to breath water, but you can't learn.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I'll learn,$94 he said, simply.<BR>
<BR>
$93Why don't you just buy yourself a spell of water breathing or a potion over at the Mages Guild?$94 she asked.  $93That's how it's generally done.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93They're not powerful enough,$94 he said. $93I need to be underwater for a long time.  I'm willing to pay whatever you ask, but I don't want any questions.  I was told you could teach me.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What's your name, boy?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93That's a question,$94 he replied.  His name was Tharien Winloth, but in Vivec, they called him the Tollman.  His job, such as it was, was collecting a percentage of the loot from the smugglers when they came into harbor to bring to his boss in the Camonna Tong.  Of the value of that percentage, he earned another percentage.  In the end it was very small indeed.  He had scarcely any gold of his own, and what he had, he gave to Seryne Relas.<BR>
<BR>
The lessons began that very day.  The sorceress brought her pupil, who she simply called $93boy,$94 out to a low sandbank along the sea.<BR>
<BR>
$93I will teach you a powerful spell for breathing water,$94 she said. $93But you must become a master of it.  As with all spells and all skills, you more you practice, the better you get.  Even that ain't enough.  To achieve true mastery, you must understand what it is you're doing.  It ain't simply enough to perform a perfect thrust of a blade -- you must also know what you are doing and why.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93That's common sense,$94 said Tharien<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, it is,$94 said Seryne, closing her eyes. $93But the spells of Alteration are all about uncommon sense.  The infinite possibilities, breaking the sky, swallowing space, dancing with time, setting ice on fire, believing that the unreal may become real.  You must learn the rules of the cosmos and then break them.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93That sounds ... very difficult,$94 replied Tharien, trying to keep a straight face.<BR>
<BR>
Seryne pointed to the small silver fish darting along the water's edge: $93They don't find it so.  They breath water just fine.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93But that's not magic.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What I'm saying to you, boy, is that it is.$94<BR>
<BR>
For several weeks, Seryne drilled her student, and the more he understood about what he was doing and the more he practiced, the longer he could breath underwater.  When he found that he could cast the spell for as long as he needed, he thanked the sorceress and bade her farewell.<BR>
<BR>
$93There is one last lesson I have to teach you,$94 she said. $93You must learn that desire is not enough.  The world will end your spell no matter how good you are, and no matter how much you want it.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93That's a lesson I'm happy not to learn,$94 he said, and left at once for the short journey back to Vivec.<BR>
<BR>
The wharfs were much the same, with all the same smells, the same sounds, and the same characters.  His boss had found a new Tollman, he learned from his mates. They were still looking out for the smuggler ship Morodrung, but they had given up hope of ever seeing it.   Tharien knew they would not.  He had seen it sink from the wharf a long time ago.<BR>
<BR>
On a moonless night, he cast his spell and dove into the thrashing purple waves.  He kept his mind on the world of possibilities, that books could sing, that green was blue, that that water was air, that every stroke and kick brought him closer to a sunken ship filled with treasure.  He felt magicka surge all around him as he pushed his way deeper down.  Ahead he saw a ghostly shadow of the Morodrung, its mast billowing in a wind of deep water currents.  He also felt his spell begin to fade.  He could break reality long enough to breath water all the way back up to the surface, but not enough to reach the ship.<BR>
<BR>
The next night, he dove again, and this time, the spell was stronger.  He could see the vessel in detail, clouded over and dusted in sediment.  The wound in its hull where it had struck the reef.  A glint of gold beckoning from within.  But still he felt reality closing in, and he had to surface.<BR>
<BR>
The third night, he made it into the steerage, past the bloated corpses of the sailors, nibbled and picked apart by fish.  Their glassy eyes bulging, their mouths stretched open.  Had they only known the spell, he thought briefly, but his mind was more occupied by the gold scattered along the floor, the boxes that contained them shattered.  He considered scooping as much he could carry into his pockets, but a sturdy iron box seemed to bespeak more treasures.<BR>
<BR>
On the wall was a row of keys.  He took each down and tried it on the locked box, but none opened it.  One key, however, was missing.  Thalien looked around the room.  Where could it be?  His eyes went to the corpse of one of the sailors, floating in a dance of death not far from the box, his hands tightly clutching something.  It was a key.  When the ship had begun to sink, this sailor had evidently gone for the iron box.  Whatever was in it had to be very valuable.<BR>
<BR>
Thalien took the sailor's key and opened the box.  It was filled with broken glass.  He rummaged around until he felt something solid, and pulled out two flasks of some kind of wine.  He smiled as he considered the foolishness of the poor alcoholic.  This was what was important to the sailor, out of all the treasure in the Morodrung. <BR>
<BR>
Then, suddenly, Thalien Winloth felt reality.<BR>
<BR>
He had not been paying attention to the grim, tireless advance of the world on his spell.  It was fading away, his ability to breath water.  There was no time to surface.  There was no time to do anything.  As he sucked in, his lungs filled with cold, briny water.<BR>
<BR>
A few days later, the smugglers working on the wharf came upon the drowned body of the former Tollman.  Finding a body in the water in Vivec was not in itself noteworthy, but the subject that they discussed over many bottles of flin was how did it happen that he drowned with two potions of water breathing in his hands.<BR>

The Wolf Queen, Book Three<BR>
by Waughin Jarth<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
From the pen of the first century third era sage Montocai:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="640F0F" SIZE="3" FACE="Magic Cards"><BR>
3E 98<BR>
The Emperor Pelagius Septim II died a few weeks before the end of the year, on the 15th of Evening Star during the festival of North Wind's Prayer, which was considered a bad omen for the Empire.  He had ruled over a difficult seventeen years.  In order to fill the bankrupt treasury, Pelagius had dismissed the Elder Council, forcing them to buy back their positions.  Several good but poor councilors had been lost.  Many say the Emperor had died as a result of being poisoned by a vengeful former Council member.<BR>
<BR>
His children came to attend his funeral and the coronation of the next Emperor.  His youngest son Prince Magnus, 19 years of age, arrived from Almalexia, where he had been a councilor to the royal court.  21-year-old Prince Cephorus arrived from Gilane with his Redguard bride, Queen Bianki.  Prince Antiochus at 43 years of age, the eldest child and heir presumptive, had been with his father in the Imperial City.  The last to appear was his only daughter, Potema, the so-called Wolf Queen of Solitude.  Thirty years old and radiantly beautiful, she arrived with a magnificent entourage, accompanied by her husband, the elderly King Mantiarco and her year-old son, Uriel.<BR>
<BR>
All expected Antiochus to assume the throne of the Empire, but no one knew what to expect from the Wolf Queen.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Magic Cards"><BR>
<BR>
3E 99<BR>
$93Lord Vhokken has been bringing several men to your sister's chambers late at night every night this week,$94 offered the Spymaster. $93Perhaps if her husband were made aware --$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My sister is a devotee of the conqueror gods Reman and Talos, not the love goddess Dibella.  She is plotting with those men, not having orgies with them.  I'd wager I've slept with more men than she has,$94 laughed Antiochus, and then grew serious. $93She's behind the delay of the council offering me the crown, I know it.  Six weeks now.  They say they need to update records and prepare for the coronation.  I'm the Emperor!  Crown me, and to Oblivion with the formalities!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Your sister is surely no friend of yours, your majesty, but there are other factors at play.  Do not forget how your father treated the Council.  It is they who need following, and if need be, strong convincing,$94 The Spymaster added, with a suggestive stab of his dagger.<BR>
<BR>
$93Do so, but keep your eye on the damnable Wolf Queen as well.  You know where to find me.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93At which brothel, your highness?$94 inquired the Spymaster.<BR>
<BR>
$93Today being Fredas, I'll be at the Cat and Goblin.$94<BR>
<BR>
The Spymaster noted in his report that night that Queen Potema had no visitors, for she was dining across the Imperial Garden at the Blue Palace with her mother, the Dowager Empress Quintilla.  It was a warm night for wintertide and surprisingly cloudless though the day had been stormy.  The saturated ground could not take any more, so the formal, structured gardens looked as if they had been glazed with water.  The two women took their wine to the wide balcony to look over the grounds.<BR>
<BR>
$93I believe you are trying to sabotage your half-brother's coronation,$94 said Quintilla, not looking at her daughter.  Potema saw how the years had not so much wrinkled her mother as faded her, like the sun on a stone.<BR>
<BR>
$93It's not true,$94 said Potema. $93But would it bother you very much if it were true?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Antiochus is not my son.  He was eleven years old when I married your father, and we've never been close.  I think that being heir presumptive has stunted his growth.  He is old enough to have a family with grown children, and yet he spends all his time at debauchery and fornication.  He will not make a very good Emperor,$94 Quintilla sighed and then turned to Potema. $93But it is bad for the family for seeds of discontent to be sown.  It is easy to divide up into factions, but very difficult to unite again.  I fear for the future of the Empire.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Those sound like the words -- are you, by any chance, dying, mother?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I've read the omens,$94 said Quintilla with a faint, ironic smile.  $93Don't forget -- I was a renowned sorceress in Camlorn.  I will dead in a few months time, and then, not a year later, your husband will die.  I only regret that I will not live to see your child Uriel assume the throne of Solitude.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Have you seen whether --$94 Potema stopped, not wanting to reveal too many of her plans, even to a dying woman.<BR>
<BR>
$93Whether he will be Emperor?  Aye, I know the answer to that too, daughter.  Don't fear: you'll live to see the answer, one way or the other.  I have a gift for him when he is of age,$94 The Dowager Empress removed a necklace with a single great yellow gem from around her neck.  $93It's a soul gem, infused with the spirit of a great werewolf your father and I defeated in battle thirty-six years ago.  I've enchanted it with spells from the School of Illusion so its wearer may charm whoever he choses.  An important skill for a king.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93And an emperor,$94 said Potema, taking the necklace. $93Thank you, mother.$94<BR>
<BR>
An hour later, passing the black branches of the sculpted douad shrubs, Potema noticed a dark figure, which vanished into the shadows under the eaves at her approach.  She had noticed people following her before: it was one of the hazards of life in the Imperial court.  But this man was too close to her chambers.  She slipped the necklace around her neck.<BR>
<BR>
$93Come out where I can see you,$94 she commanded.<BR>
<BR>
The man emerged from the shadows.  A dark little fellow of middle-age dressed in black-dyed goatskin.  His eyes were fixed, frozen, under her spell.<BR>
<BR>
$93Who do you work for?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Prince Antiochus is my master,$94 he said in a dead voice. $93I am his spy.$94<BR>
<BR>
A plan formed.  $93Is the Prince in his study?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93No, milady.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93And you have access?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, milady.$94<BR>
<BR>
Potema smiled widely.  She had him.  $93Lead the way.$94<BR>
<BR>
The next morning, the storm reappeared in all its fury.  The pelting on the walls and ceiling was agony to Antiochus, who was discovering that he no longer had his youthful immunity to a late night of hard drinking. He shoved hard against the Argonian wench sharing his bed.<BR>
<BR>
$93Make yourself useful and close the window,$94 he moaned.<BR>
<BR>
No sooner had the window been bolted then there was a knock at the door.  It was the Spymaster.  He smiled at the Prince and handed him a sheet of paper.<BR>
<BR>
$93What is this?$94 said Antiochus, squinting his eyes. $93I must still be drunk.  It looks like orcish.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I think you will find it useful, your majesty.  Your sister is here to see you.$94<BR>
<BR>
Antiochus considered getting dressed or sending his bedmate out, but thought better of it. $93Show her in.  Let her be scandalized.$94<BR>
<BR>
If Potema was scandalized, she did not show it.  Swathed in orange and silver silk, she entered the room with a triumphant smile, followed by the man-mountain Lord Vhokken.<BR>
<BR>
$93Dear brother, I spoke to my mother last night, and she advised me very wisely.  She said I should not battle with you in public, for the good of our family and the Empire.  Therefore,$94 she said, producing from the folds of her robe a piece of paper. $93I am offering you a choice.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93A choice?$94 said Antiochus, returning her smile. $93That does sound friendly.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Abdicate your rights to the Imperial throne voluntarily, and there is no need for me to show the Council this,$94 Potema said, handing her brother the letter. $93It is a letter with your seal on it, saying that you knew that your father was not Pelagius Septim II, but the royal steward Fondoukth.  Now, before you deny writing the letter, you cannot deny the rumors, nor that the Imperial Council will believe that your father, the old fool, was quite capable of being cuckolded.  Whether it's true or not, or whether the letter is a forgery or not, the scandal of it would ruin your chances of being the Emperor.$94<BR>
<BR>
Antiochus's face had gone white with fury.<BR>
<BR>
$93Don't fear, brother,$94 said Potema, taking back the letter from his shaking hands. $93I will see to it that you have a very comfortable life, and all the whores your heart, or any other organ, desires.$94<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly Antiochus laughed.  He looked over at his Spymaster and winked. $93I remember when you broke into my stash of Khajiiti erotica and blackmailed me.  That was close to twenty years ago.  We've got better locks now, you must have noticed.  It must have killed you that you couldn't use your own skills to get what you wanted.$94<BR>
<BR>
Potema merely smiled.  It didn't matter.  She had him.<BR>
<BR>
$93You must have charmed my servant here into getting you into my study to use my seal,$94 Antiochus smirked. $93A spell, perhaps, from your mother, the witch?$94<BR>
<BR>
Potema continued to smile.  Her brother was cleverer than she thought.<BR>
<BR>
$93Did you know that Charm spells, even powerful ones, only last so long?   Of course, you didn't.  You never were one for magic.  Let me tell you, a generous salary is a stronger motivation for keeping a servant in the long run, sister,$94 Antiochus took out his own sheet of paper. $93Now I have a choice for you.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What is that?$94 said Potema, her smile faltering.<BR>
<BR>
$93It looks like nonsense, but if you know what you're looking for, it's very clear.  It's a practice sheet -- your handwriting attempting to look like my handwriting.  It's a good gift you have.  I wonder if you haven't done this before, imitating another person's handwriting.  I understand a letter was found from your husband's dead wife saying that his first son was a bastard.  I wonder if you wrote that letter.  I wonder if I showed this evidence of your gift to your husband whether he would believe you wrote that letter.  In the future, dear Wolf Queen, don't lay the same trap twice.$94<BR>
<BR>
Potema shook her head, furious, unable to speak.<BR>
<BR>
$93Give me your forgery and go take a walk in the rain.  And then, later today, unhatch whatever other plots you have to keep me from the throne.$94  Antiochus fixed his eyes on Potema's. $93I will be Emperor, Wolf Queen.  Now go.$94<BR>
<BR>
Potema handed her brother the letter and left the room.  For a few moments, out in the hallway, she said nothing.  She merely glared at the slivers of rainwater dripping down the marble wall from a tiny, unseen crack.<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, you will, brother,$94 she said. $93But not for very long.$94<BR>

The Wolf Queen, Book Three<BR>

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
From the pen of the first century third era sage Montocai:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="640F0F" SIZE="3" FACE="Magic Cards"><BR>
3E 98<BR>
The Emperor Pelagius Septim II died a few weeks before the end of the year, on the 15th of Evening Star during the festival of North Wind's Prayer, which was considered a bad omen for the Empire.  He had ruled over a difficult seventeen years.  In order to fill the bankrupt treasury, Pelagius had dismissed the Elder Council, forcing them to buy back their positions.  Several good but poor councilors had been lost.  Many say the Emperor had died as a result of being poisoned by a vengeful former Council member.<BR>
<BR>
His children came to attend his funeral and the coronation of the next Emperor.  His youngest son Prince Magnus, 19 years of age, arrived from Almalexia, where he had been a councilor to the royal court.  21-year-old Prince Cephorus arrived from Gilane with his Redguard bride, Queen Bianki.  Prince Antiochus at 43 years of age, the eldest child and heir presumptive, had been with his father in the Imperial City.  The last to appear was his only daughter, Potema, the so-called Wolf Queen of Solitude.  Thirty years old and radiantly beautiful, she arrived with a magnificent entourage, accompanied by her husband, the elderly King Mantiarco and her year-old son, Uriel.<BR>
<BR>
All expected Antiochus to assume the throne of the Empire, but no one knew what to expect from the Wolf Queen.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Magic Cards"><BR>

3E 99<BR>
$93Lord Vhokken has been bringing several men to your sister's chambers late at night every night this week,$94 offered the Spymaster. $93Perhaps if her husband were made aware --$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My sister is a devotee of the conqueror gods Reman and Talos, not the love goddess Dibella.  She is plotting with those men, not having orgies with them.  I'd wager I've slept with more men than she has,$94 laughed Antiochus, and then grew serious. $93She's behind the delay of the council offering me the crown, I know it.  Six weeks now.  They say they need to update records and prepare for the coronation.  I'm the Emperor!  Crown me, and to Oblivion with the formalities!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Your sister is surely no friend of yours, your majesty, but there are other factors at play.  Do not forget how your father treated the Council.  It is they who need following, and if need be, strong convincing,$94 The Spymaster added, with a suggestive stab of his dagger.<BR>
<BR>
$93Do so, but keep your eye on the damnable Wolf Queen as well.  You know where to find me.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93At which brothel, your highness?$94 inquired the Spymaster.<BR>
<BR>
$93Today being Fredas, I'll be at the Cat and Goblin.$94<BR>
<BR>
The Spymaster noted in his report that night that Queen Potema had no visitors, for she was dining across the Imperial Garden at the Blue Palace with her mother, the Dowager Empress Quintilla.  It was a warm night for wintertide and surprisingly cloudless though the day had been stormy.  The saturated ground could not take any more, so the formal, structured gardens looked as if they had been glazed with water.  The two women took their wine to the wide balcony to look over the grounds.<BR>
<BR>
$93I believe you are trying to sabotage your half-brother's coronation,$94 said Quintilla, not looking at her daughter.  Potema saw how the years had not so much wrinkled her mother as faded her, like the sun on a stone.<BR>
<BR>
$93It's not true,$94 said Potema. $93But would it bother you very much if it were true?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Antiochus is not my son.  He was eleven years old when I married your father, and we've never been close.  I think that being heir presumptive has stunted his growth.  He is old enough to have a family with grown children, and yet he spends all his time at debauchery and fornication.  He will not make a very good Emperor,$94 Quintilla sighed and then turned to Potema. $93But it is bad for the family for seeds of discontent to be sown.  It is easy to divide up into factions, but very difficult to unite again.  I fear for the future of the Empire.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Those sound like the words -- are you, by any chance, dying, mother?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I've read the omens,$94 said Quintilla with a faint, ironic smile.  $93Don't forget -- I was a renowned sorceress in Camlorn.  I will dead in a few months time, and then, not a year later, your husband will die.  I only regret that I will not live to see your child Uriel assume the throne of Solitude.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Have you seen whether --$94 Potema stopped, not wanting to reveal too many of her plans, even to a dying woman.<BR>
<BR>
$93Whether he will be Emperor?  Aye, I know the answer to that too, daughter.  Don't fear: you'll live to see the answer, one way or the other.  I have a gift for him when he is of age,$94 The Dowager Empress removed a necklace with a single great yellow gem from around her neck.  $93It's a soul gem, infused with the spirit of a great werewolf your father and I defeated in battle thirty-six years ago.  I've enchanted it with spells from the School of Illusion so its wearer may charm whoever he chooses.  An important skill for a king.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93And an emperor,$94 said Potema, taking the necklace. $93Thank you, mother.$94<BR>
<BR>
An hour later, passing the black branches of the sculpted douad shrubs, Potema noticed a dark figure, which vanished into the shadows under the eaves at her approach.  She had noticed people following her before: it was one of the hazards of life in the Imperial court.  But this man was too close to her chambers.  She slipped the necklace around her neck.<BR>
<BR>
$93Come out where I can see you,$94 she commanded.<BR>
<BR>
The man emerged from the shadows.  A dark little fellow of middle-age dressed in black-dyed goatskin.  His eyes were fixed, frozen, under her spell.<BR>
<BR>
$93Who do you work for?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Prince Antiochus is my master,$94 he said in a dead voice. $93I am his spy.$94<BR>
<BR>
A plan formed.  $93Is the Prince in his study?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93No, milady.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93And you have access?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, milady.$94<BR>
<BR>
Potema smiled widely.  She had him.  $93Lead the way.$94<BR>
<BR>
The next morning, the storm reappeared in all its fury.  The pelting on the walls and ceiling was agony to Antiochus, who was discovering that he no longer had his youthful immunity to a late night of hard drinking. He shoved hard against the Argonian wench sharing his bed.<BR>
<BR>
$93Make yourself useful and close the window,$94 he moaned.<BR>
<BR>
No sooner had the window been bolted then there was a knock at the door.  It was the Spymaster.  He smiled at the Prince and handed him a sheet of paper.<BR>
<BR>
$93What is this?$94 said Antiochus, squinting his eyes. $93I must still be drunk.  It looks like orcish.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I think you will find it useful, your majesty.  Your sister is here to see you.$94<BR>
<BR>
Antiochus considered getting dressed or sending his bedmate out, but thought better of it. $93Show her in.  Let her be scandalized.$94<BR>
<BR>
If Potema was scandalized, she did not show it.  Swathed in orange and silver silk, she entered the room with a triumphant smile, followed by the man-mountain Lord Vhokken.<BR>
<BR>
$93Dear brother, I spoke to my mother last night, and she advised me very wisely.  She said I should not battle with you in public, for the good of our family and the Empire.  Therefore,$94 she said, producing from the folds of her robe a piece of paper. $93I am offering you a choice.$94<BR>

$93Yes, you will, brother,$94 she said. $93But not for very long.$94<BR>

2920, The Last Year of the First Era<BR>

2 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Gideon, Black Marsh<BR>
<BR>
The Empress Tavia lay across her bed, a hot late summer wind she could not feel banging the shutters of her cell to and fro against the iron bars.  Her throat felt like it was on fire but still she sobbed, uncontrollably, wringing her last tapestry in her hands.  Her wailing echoed throughout the hollow halls of Castle Giovese, stopping maids in their washing and guards in their conversation.  One of her women came up the narrow stairs to see her mistress, but her chief guard Zuuk stood at the doorway and shook his head.<BR>
<BR>
$93She's just heard that her son is dead,$94 he said quietly.<BR>
<BR>
5 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
The Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>
<BR>
$93Your Imperial Majesty,$94 said the Potentate Versidue-Shaie through the door. $93You can open the door.  I assure you, you're perfectly safe.  No one wants to kill you.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Mara's blood!$94 came the Emperor Reman III's voice, muffled, hysterical, tinged with madness. $93Someone assassinated the Prince, and he was holding my shield!  They could have thought he was me!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93You're certainly correct, your Imperial Majesty,$94 replied the Potentate, expunging any mocking qualities from his voice while his black-slitted eyes rolled contemptuously. $93And we must find and punish the evildoer responsible for your son's death.  But we cannot do it without you.  You must be brave for your Empire.$94<BR>
<BR>
There was no reply.<BR>
<BR>
$93At the very least, come out and sign the order for Lady Rijja's execution,$94 called the Potentate. $93Let us dispose of the one traitor and assassin we know of.$94<BR>
<BR>
A brief pause, and then the sound of furniture scraping across the floor.  Reman opened the door just a crack, but the Potentate could see his angry, fearful face, and the terrible mound of ripped tissue that used to be his right eye.  Despite the best healers in the Empire, it was still a ghastly souvenir of the Lady Rijja's work in Thurzo Fortress.<BR>
<BR>
$93Hand me the order,$94 the Emperor snarled. $93I'll sign it with pleasure.$94<BR>
<BR>
6 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Gideon, Cyrodiil<BR>
<BR>
The strange blue glow of the will o' the wisps, a combination, so she'd be told, of swamp gas and spiritual energy, had always frightened Tavia as she looked out her window.  Now it seemed strangely comforting.  Beyond the bog lay the city of Gideon.  It was funny, she thought, that she had never stepped foot in its streets, though she had watched it ever day for seventeen years.<BR>
<BR>
$93Can you think of anything I've forgotten?$94 she asked, turning to look back on the loyal Kothringi Zuuk.<BR>
<BR>
$93I know exactly what to do,$94 he said simply.  He seemed to smile, but the Empress realized that it was only her own face reflected in his silvery skin.  She was smiling, and she didn't even realize it.<BR>
<BR>
$93Make certain you aren't followed,$94 she warned. $93I don't want my husband to know where my gold's been hiding all these years.  And do take your share of it.  You've been a good friend.$94<BR>
<BR>
The Empress Tavia stepped forward and dropped from sight into the mists.  Zuuk replaced the bars on the tower window, and threw a blanket over some pillows on her bed.  With any luck, they would not discover her body on the lawn until morning, at which time he hoped to be halfway to Morrowind.<BR>
<BR>
9 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Phrygias, High Rock<BR>
<BR>
The strange trees on all sides resembled knobby piles crowned with great bursts of reds, yellows, and oranges, like insect mounds caught fire.  The Wrothgarian mountains were fading into the misty afternoon.  Turala marveled at the sight, so alien, so different from Morrowind, as she plodded the horse forward into an open pasture.  Behind her, head nodding against his chest, Cassyr slept, cradling Bosriel.  For a moment, Turala considered jumping the low painted fence that crossed the field, but she thought better of it.  Let Cassyr sleep for a few more hours before giving him the reigns.<BR>
<BR>
As the horse passed into the field, Turala saw the small green house on the next hill, half-hidden in forest.  So picturesque was the image, she felt herself lull into a pleasant half-sleeping state.  A blast of a horn brought her back to reality with a shudder.  Cassyr opened his eyes.<BR>
<BR>
$93Where are we?$94 he hissed.<BR>
<BR>
$93I don't know,$94 Turala stammered, wide-eyed. $93What is that sound?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Orcs,$94 he whispered. $93A hunting party.  Head for the thicket quickly.$94<BR>
<BR>
Turala trotted the horse into the small collection of trees. Cassyr handed her the child and dismounted.  He began pulling their bags off next, throwing them into the bushes.  A sound started then, a distant rumbling of footfall, growing louder and closer.  Turala climbed off carefully and helped Cassyr unburden the horse.  All the while, Bosriel watched open-eyed.  Turala sometimes worried that her baby never cried.  Now she was grateful for it.  With the last of the luggage off, Cassyr slapped the horse's rear, sending it galloping into the field.  Taking Turala's hand, he hunkered down in the bushes.<BR>
<BR>
$93With luck,$94 he murmured. $93They'll think she's wild or belongs to the farm and won't go looking for the rider.$94<BR>
<BR>
As he spoke, a horde of orcs surged into the field, blasting their horns.  Turala had seen orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence.  Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid.  The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds.  Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded.  One of the orcs heard something though, and brought another with him to investigate.<BR>
<BR>
Cassyr quietly unsheathed his sword, mustering all the confidence he could.  His skills, such as they were, were in spying, not combat, but he vowed to protect Turala and her babe for as long as he could.  Perhaps he would slay these two, he reasoned, but not before they cried out and brought the rest of the horde.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, something invisible swept through the bushes like a wind.  The orcs flew backwards, falling dead on their backs.  Turala turned and saw a wrinkled crone with bright red hair emerge from a nearby bush.<BR>
<BR>
$93I thought you were going to bring 'em right to me,$94 she whispered, smiling. $93Best come with me.$94<BR>
<BR>
The three followed the old woman through a deep crevasse of bramble bushes that ran through the field toward the house on the hill.  As they emerged on the other side, the woman turned to look at the orcs feasting on the remains of the horse, a blood-soaked orgy to the beat of multiple horns.<BR>
<BR>
$93That horse yours?$94 she asked.  When Cassyr nodded, she laughed loudly. $93That's rich meat, that is.  Those monsters'll have bellyaches and flatulence in the morning.  Serves 'em right.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Shouldn't we keep moving?$94 whispered Turala, unnerved by the woman's laughter.<BR>
<BR>
$93They won't come up here,$94 she grinned, looking at Bosriel who smiled back. $93They're too afraid of us.$94<BR>
<BR>
Turala turned to Cassyr, who shook his head. $93Witches.  Am I correct in assuming that this is Old Barbyn's Farm, the home of the Skeffington Coven?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93You are, pet,$94 the old woman giggled girlishly, pleased to be so infamous. $93I am Mynista Skeffington.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What did you do to those orcs?$94 asked Turala. $93Back there in the thicket?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Spirit fist right side the head,$94 Mynista said, continuing the climb up the hill.  Ahead of them was the farmhouse grounds, a well, a chicken coop, a pond, women of all ages doing chores, the laughter of children at play.  The old woman turned and saw that Turala did not understand. $93Don't you have witches where you come from, child?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93None that I know of,$94 she said.<BR>
<BR>
$93There are all sorts of wielders of magic in Tamriel,$94 she explained. $93The Psijics study magic like its their painful duty.  The battlemages in the army on the other end of the scale hurl spells like arrows.  We witches commune and conjure and celebrate.  To fell those orcs, I merely whispered to the spirits of the air, Amaro, Pina, Tallatha, the fingers of Kynareth, and the breath of the world, with whom I have an intimate acquaintance, to smack those bastards dead.  You see, conjuration is not about might, or solving riddles, or agonizing over musty old scrolls.  It's about fostering relations.  Being friendly, you might say.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Well, we certainly appreciate you being friendly with us,$94 said Cassyr.<BR>
<BR>
$93As well you might,$94 coughed Mynista. $93Your kind destroyed the orc homeland two thousand years ago.  Before that, they never came all the way up here and bothered us.  Now let's get you cleaned up and fed.$94<BR>
<BR>
With that, Mynista led them into the farm, and Turala met the family of the Skeffington Coven.<BR>
<BR>
11 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
The Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>
<BR>
Rijja had not even tried to sleep the night before, and she found the somber music played during her execution to have a soporific effect.  It was as if she was willing herself to be unconscious before the ax stroke.  Her eyes were bound so she could not see her former lover, the Emperor, seated before her, glaring with his one good eye.  She could not see the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, his coil neatly wrapped beneath him, a look of triumph in his golden face.  She could feel, numbly, the executioner's hand touch her back to steady her.  She flinched like a dreamer trying to awake.  <BR>
<BR>
The first blow caught the back of her head and she screamed.  The next hacked through her neck, and she was dead.<BR>
<BR>
The Emperor turned to the Potentate wearily, $93Now that's done.  You said she had a pretty sister in Hammerfell named Corda?$94<BR>
<BR>
18 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Dwynnen, High Rock<BR>
<BR>
The horse the witches had sold him was not as good as his old one, Cassyr considered.  Spirit worship and sacrifice and sisterhood might be all well and good for conjuring spirits, but it tends to spoil beasts of burden.  Still, there was little to complain about.  With the Dunmer woman and her child gone, he had made excellent time.  Ahead were the walls surrounding the city of his homeland.  Almost at once, he was set upon by his old friends and family.<BR>
<BR>
$93How went the war?$94 cried his cousin, running to the road. $93Is it true that Vivec signed a peace with the Prince, but the Emperor refuses to honor it?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93That's not how it was, was it?$94 asked a friend, joining them. $93I heard that the Dunmer had the Prince murdered and then made up a story about a treaty, but there's no evidence for it.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Isn't there anything interesting happening here?$94 Cassyr laughed. $93I really don't have the least interest in discussing the war or Vivec.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93You missed the procession of the Lady Corda,$94 said his friend. $93She came across the bay with full entourage and then east to the Imperial City.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93But that's nothing.  What was Vivec like?$94 asked his cousin eagerly. $93He supposed to be a living god.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93If Sheogorath steps down and they need another God of Madness, he'll do,$94 said Cassyr haughtily.<BR>
<BR>
$93And the women?$94 asked the lad, who had only seen Dunmer ladies on very rare occasions.<BR>
<BR>
Cassyr merely smiled.  Turala Skeffington flashed into his mind for an instant before fading away.  She would be happy with the coven, and her child would be well cared for.

2 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Gideon, Black Marsh<BR>
<BR>
The Empress Tavia lay across her bed, a hot late summer wind she could not feel banging the shutters of her cell to and fro against the iron bars.  Her throat felt like it was on fire but still she sobbed, uncontrollably, wringing her last tapestry in her hands.  Her wailing echoed throughout the hollow halls of Castle Giovese, stopping maids in their washing and guards in their conversation.  One of her women came up the narrow stairs to see her mistress, but her chief guard Zuuk stood at the doorway and shook his head.<BR>
<BR>
$93She's just heard that her son is dead,$94 he said quietly.<BR>
<BR>
5 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
The Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>
<BR>
$93Your Imperial Majesty,$94 said the Potentate Versidue-Shaie through the door. $93You can open the door.  I assure you, you're perfectly safe.  No one wants to kill you.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Mara's blood!$94 came the Emperor Reman III's voice, muffled, hysterical, tinged with madness. $93Someone assassinated the Prince, and he was holding my shield!  They could have thought he was me!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93You're certainly correct, your Imperial Majesty,$94 replied the Potentate, expunging any mocking qualities from his voice while his black-slitted eyes rolled contemptuously. $93And we must find and punish the evildoer responsible for your son's death.  But we cannot do it without you.  You must be brave for your Empire.$94<BR>
<BR>
There was no reply.<BR>
<BR>
$93At the very least, come out and sign the order for Lady Rijja's execution,$94 called the Potentate. $93Let us dispose of the one traitor and assassin we know of.$94<BR>
<BR>
A brief pause, and then the sound of furniture scraping across the floor.  Reman opened the door just a crack, but the Potentate could see his angry, fearful face, and the terrible mound of ripped tissue that used to be his right eye.  Despite the best healers in the Empire, it was still a ghastly souvenir of the Lady Rijja's work in Thurzo Fortress.<BR>
<BR>
$93Hand me the order,$94 the Emperor snarled. $93I'll sign it with pleasure.$94<BR>
<BR>
6 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Gideon, Cyrodiil<BR>
<BR>
The strange blue glow of the will o' the wisps, a combination, so she'd be told, of swamp gas and spiritual energy, had always frightened Tavia as she looked out her window.  Now it seemed strangely comforting.  Beyond the bog lay the city of Gideon.  It was funny, she thought, that she had never stepped foot in its streets, though she had watched it ever day for seventeen years.<BR>
<BR>
$93Can you think of anything I've forgotten?$94 she asked, turning to look back on the loyal Kothringi Zuuk.<BR>
<BR>
$93I know exactly what to do,$94 he said simply.  He seemed to smile, but the Empress realized that it was only her own face reflected in his silvery skin.  She was smiling, and she didn't even realize it.<BR>
<BR>
$93Make certain you aren't followed,$94 she warned. $93I don't want my husband to know where my gold's been hiding all these years.  And do take your share of it.  You've been a good friend.$94<BR>
<BR>
The Empress Tavia stepped forward and dropped from sight into the mists.  Zuuk replaced the bars on the tower window, and threw a blanket over some pillows on her bed.  With any luck, they would not discover her body on the lawn until morning, at which time he hoped to be halfway to Morrowind.<BR>
<BR>
9 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Phrygias, High Rock<BR>
<BR>
The strange trees on all sides resembled knobby piles crowned with great bursts of reds, yellows, and oranges, like insect mounds caught fire.  The Wrothgarian mountains were fading into the misty afternoon.  Turala marveled at the sight, so alien, so different from Morrowind, as she plodded the horse forward into an open pasture.  Behind her, head nodding against his chest, Cassyr slept, cradling Bosriel.  For a moment, Turala considered jumping the low painted fence that crossed the field, but she thought better of it.  Let Cassyr sleep for a few more hours before giving him the reigns.<BR>
<BR>
As the horse passed into the field, Turala saw the small green house on the next hill, half-hidden in forest.  So picturesque was the image, she felt herself lull into a pleasant half-sleeping state.  A blast of a horn brought her back to reality with a shudder.  Cassyr opened his eyes.<BR>
<BR>
$93Where are we?$94 he hissed.<BR>
<BR>
$93I don't know,$94 Turala stammered, wide-eyed. $93What is that sound?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Orcs,$94 he whispered. $93A hunting party.  Head for the thicket quickly.$94<BR>
<BR>
Turala trotted the horse into the small collection of trees. Cassyr handed her the child and dismounted.  He began pulling their bags off next, throwing them into the bushes.  A sound started then, a distant rumbling of footfall, growing louder and closer.  Turala climbed off carefully and helped Cassyr unburden the horse.  All the while, Bosriel watched open-eyed.  Turala sometimes worried that her baby never cried.  Now she was grateful for it.  With the last of the luggage off, Cassyr slapped the horse's rear, sending it galloping into the field.  Taking Turala's hand, he hunkered down in the bushes.<BR>
<BR>
$93With luck,$94 he murmured. $93They'll think she's wild or belongs to the farm and won't go looking for the rider.$94<BR>
<BR>
As he spoke, a horde of orcs surged into the field, blasting their horns.  Turala had seen orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence.  Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid.  The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds.  Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded.  One of the orcs heard something though, and brought another with him to investigate.<BR>
<BR>
Cassyr quietly unsheathed his sword, mustering all the confidence he could.  His skills, such as they were, were in spying, not combat, but he vowed to protect Turala and her babe for as long as he could.  Perhaps he would slay these two, he reasoned, but not before they cried out and brought the rest of the horde.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, something invisible swept through the bushes like a wind.  The orcs flew backwards, falling dead on their backs.  Turala turned and saw a wrinkled crone with bright red hair emerge from a nearby bush.<BR>
<BR>
$93I thought you were going to bring 'em right to me,$94 she whispered, smiling. $93Best come with me.$94<BR>
<BR>
The three followed the old woman through a deep crevasse of bramble bushes that ran through the field toward the house on the hill.  As they emerged on the other side, the woman turned to look at the orcs feasting on the remains of the horse, a blood-soaked orgy to the beat of multiple horns.<BR>
<BR>
$93That horse yours?$94 she asked.  When Cassyr nodded, she laughed loudly. $93That's rich meat, that is.  Those monsters'll have bellyaches and flatulence in the morning.  Serves 'em right.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Shouldn't we keep moving?$94 whispered Turala, unnerved by the woman's laughter.<BR>
<BR>
$93They won't come up here,$94 she grinned, looking at Bosriel who smiled back. $93They're too afraid of us.$94<BR>
<BR>
Turala turned to Cassyr, who shook his head. $93Witches.  Am I correct in assuming that this is Old Barbyn's Farm, the home of the Skeffington Coven?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93You are, pet,$94 the old woman giggled girlishly, pleased to be so infamous. $93I am Mynista Skeffington.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What did you do to those orcs?$94 asked Turala. $93Back there in the thicket?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Spirit fist right side the head,$94 Mynista said, continuing the climb up the hill.  Ahead of them was the farmhouse grounds, a well, a chicken coop, a pond, women of all ages doing chores, the laughter of children at play.  The old woman turned and saw that Turala did not understand. $93Don't you have witches where you come from, child?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93None that I know of,$94 she said.<BR>
<BR>
$93There are all sorts of wielders of magic in Tamriel,$94 she explained. $93The Psijics study magic like it's their painful duty.  The battlemages in the army on the other end of the scale hurl spells like arrows.  We witches commune and conjure and celebrate.  To fell those orcs, I merely whispered to the spirits of the air, Amaro, Pina, Tallatha, the fingers of Kynareth, and the breath of the world, with whom I have an intimate acquaintance, to smack those bastards dead.  You see, conjuration is not about might, or solving riddles, or agonizing over musty old scrolls.  It's about fostering relations.  Being friendly, you might say.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Well, we certainly appreciate you being friendly with us,$94 said Cassyr.<BR>
<BR>
$93As well you might,$94 coughed Mynista. $93Your kind destroyed the orc homeland two thousand years ago.  Before that, they never came all the way up here and bothered us.  Now let's get you cleaned up and fed.$94<BR>
<BR>
With that, Mynista led them into the farm, and Turala met the family of the Skeffington Coven.<BR>
<BR>
11 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
The Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>
<BR>
Rijja had not even tried to sleep the night before, and she found the somber music played during her execution to have a soporific effect.  It was as if she was willing herself to be unconscious before the ax stroke.  Her eyes were bound so she could not see her former lover, the Emperor, seated before her, glaring with his one good eye.  She could not see the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, his coil neatly wrapped beneath him, a look of triumph in his golden face.  She could feel, numbly, the executioner's hand touch her back to steady her.  She flinched like a dreamer trying to awake.  <BR>
<BR>
The first blow caught the back of her head and she screamed.  The next hacked through her neck, and she was dead.<BR>
<BR>
The Emperor turned to the Potentate wearily, $93Now that's done.  You said she had a pretty sister in Hammerfell named Corda?$94<BR>
<BR>
18 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Dwynnen, High Rock<BR>
<BR>
The horse the witches had sold him was not as good as his old one, Cassyr considered.  Spirit worship and sacrifice and sisterhood might be all well and good for conjuring spirits, but it tends to spoil beasts of burden.  Still, there was little to complain about.  With the Dunmer woman and her child gone, he had made excellent time.  Ahead were the walls surrounding the city of his homeland.  Almost at once, he was set upon by his old friends and family.<BR>
<BR>
$93How went the war?$94 cried his cousin, running to the road. $93Is it true that Vivec signed a peace with the Prince, but the Emperor refuses to honor it?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93That's not how it was, was it?$94 asked a friend, joining them. $93I heard that the Dunmer had the Prince murdered and then made up a story about a treaty, but there's no evidence for it.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Isn't there anything interesting happening here?$94 Cassyr laughed. $93I really don't have the least interest in discussing the war or Vivec.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93You missed the procession of the Lady Corda,$94 said his friend. $93She came across the bay with full entourage and then east to the Imperial City.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93But that's nothing.  What was Vivec like?$94 asked his cousin eagerly. $93He supposed to be a living god.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93If Sheogorath steps down and they need another God of Madness, he'll do,$94 said Cassyr haughtily.<BR>
<BR>
$93And the women?$94 asked the lad, who had only seen Dunmer ladies on very rare occasions.<BR>
<BR>
Cassyr merely smiled.  Turala Skeffington flashed into his mind for an instant before fading away.  She would be happy with the coven, and her child would be well cared for.  But they were part of the past now, a place and a war he wanted to forget forever.  Dismounting his horse, he walked it into the city, chatting of trivial gossip of life on the Iliac Bay.<BR>

Interviews With Tapestrists<BR>
Volume Eighteen<BR>
Cherim's Heart of Anequina<BR>
by Livillus Perus<BR>
Professor at the Imperial University<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
Contemporary with Maqamat Lusign (interviewed in volume seventeen of this series) is the Khajiti Cherim, whose tapestries have been hailed as masterpieces all over the Empire for nigh on thirty years now. His four factories located throughout Elsweyr make reproductions of his work, but his original tapestries command stellar prices.  The Emperor himself owns ten Cherim tapestries, and his representatives are currently negotiating the sale of five more.<BR>
<BR>
The muted use of color contrasted with the luminous skin tones of Cherim's subjects is a marked contrast with the old style of tapestry.  The subjects of his work in recent years have been fabulous tales of the ancient past: the Gods meeting to discuss the formation of the world; the Chimer following the Prophet Veloth into Morrowind;  the Wild Elves battling Morihaus and his legions at the White Gold Tower.  His earliest designs dealt with more contemporary subjects.  I had the opportunity to discuss with him one of his first masterpieces, The Heart of Anequina, at his villa in Orcrest.<BR>
<BR>
The Heart of Anequina presents an historic battle of the Five Year War between Elsweyr and Valenwood which raged from 3E 394 (or 3E 395, depending on what one considers to be the beginning of the war) until 3E 399.  In most fair accounts, the war lasted 4 years and 9 months, but artistic license from the great epic poets added an additional three months to the ordeal.<BR>
<BR>
The actual details of the battle itself, as interpreted by Cherim, are explicit.  The faces of a hundred and twenty Wood Elf archers can be differentiated one from the other, each registering fear at the approach of the Khajiti army.  Their hauberks catch the dim light of the sun.  The menacing shadows of the Elsweyr battlecats loom on the hills, every muscle strained, ready to pounce in command.  It is not surprising that he got all the details right, because Cherim was in the midst of it, as a Khajiti foot soldier.<BR>
<BR>
Every minute part of the Khajiti medium-weight armor can be seen in the soldiers in the foreground.  The embroidered edging and striped patterns on the tunics.  Each lacquered plate on loose-fitting leather in the Elsweyr style.  The helmets of cloth and fluted silver.<BR>
<BR>
$93Cherim does not understand the point of plate mail,$94 said Cherim. $93It is hot, for one, like being both burned and buried alive. Cherim wore it at the insistence of our Nord advisors during the Battle of Zelinin, and Cherim couldn't even turn to see what my fellow Khajiit were doing.  Cherim did some sketches for a tapestry of the Battle of Zelinin, but Cherim finds that to make it realistic, the figures came out very mechanical, like iron golems or dwemer centurions.  Knowing our Khajiti commanders, Cherim would not be surprised if giving up the heavy plate was more aesthetic than practical.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Elsweyr lost the Battle of Zelinin, didn't she?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, but Elsweyr won the war, starting at the next battle, the Heart of Anequina,$94 said Cherim with a smile. $93The tide turned as soon as we Khajiit sent our Nordic advisors back to Solitude.  We had to get rid of all the heavy armor they brought to us and find enough traditional medium armor our troops felt comfortable wearing. Obviously, the principle advantage of the medium armor was that we could move easily in it, as you can see from the natural stances of the soldiers in the tapestry.  <BR>
<BR>
$93Now if you look at this poor perforated Cathay-raht who just keeps battling on in the bottom background, you see the other advantage.  It seems strange to say, but one of the best features of medium armor is that an arrow will either deflect completely or pass all the way through. An arrow head is like a hook, made to stick where it strikes if it doesn't pass through.  A soldier in medium armor will find himself with a hole in his body and the bolt on the other side. Our healers can fix such a wound easily if it isn't fatal, but if the arrow still remains in the armor, as it does with heavier armor, the wound will be reopened every time the fellow moves. Unless the Khajiit strips off the armor and pulls out the arrow, which is what we had to do at the Battle of Zelinin. A difficult and time-consuming process in the heat of battle, to say the least.$94<BR>
<BR>
I asked him next, $93Is there a self portrait in the battle?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes,$94 Cherim said with another grin. $93You see the small figure of the Khajiit stealing the rings off the dead Wood Elf?  His back is facing you, but he has a brown and orange striped tail like Cherim's. Cherim does not say that all stereotypes about the Khajiit are fair, but Cherim must sometimes acknowledge them.$94<BR>
<BR>
A self-deprecating style in self-portraiture is also evident in the tapestries of Ranulf Hook, the next artist interviewed in volume nineteen of this series.<BR>

Chimarvamidium<BR>
Ancient Tales of the Dwemer, Part VI<BR>
By Marobar Sul<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
After many battles, it was clear who would win the War.  The Chimer had great skills in magick and bladery, but against the armored battalions of the Dwemer, clad in the finest shielding wrought by Jnaggo, there was little hope of their ever winning.   In the interests of keeping some measure of peace in the Land, Sthovin the Warlord agreed to a truce with Karenithil Barif the Beast.  In exchange for the Disputed Lands, Sthovin gave Barif a mighty golem, which would protect the Chimer's territory from the excursions of the Northern Barbarians.<BR>
<BR>
Barif was delighted with his gift and brought it back to his camp, where all his warriors gaped in awe at it.  Sparkling gold in hue, it resembled a Dwemer cavalier with a proud aspect.  To test its strength, they placed the golem in the center of an arena and flung magickal bolts of lightning at it.  Its agility was such that few of the bolts struck it.  It had the wherewithal to pivot on its hips to avoid the brunt of the attacks without losing its balance, feet firmly planted on the ground.  A vault of fireballs followed, which the golem ably dodged, bending its knees and its legs to spin around the blasts.  The few times it was struck, it made certain to be hit in the chest and waist, the strongest parts of its body.<BR>
<BR>
The troops cheered at the sight of such an agile and powerful creation.  With it leading the defense, the Barbarians of Skyrim would never again successfully raid their villages.  They named it Chimarvamidium, the Hope of the Chimer.<BR>
<BR>
Barif has the golem brought to his chambers with all his housethanes.  There they tested Chimarvamidium further, its strength, its speed, its resiliency.  They could find no flaw with its design.<BR>
<BR>
$93Imagine when the naked barbarians first meet this on one of their raids,$94 laughed one of the housethanes.<BR>
<BR>
$93It is only unfortunate that it resembles a Dwemer instead of one of our own,$94 mused Karenithil Barif. $93It is revolting to think that they will have a greater respect for our other enemies than us.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I think we should never accepted the peace terms that we did,$94 said another, one of the most aggressive of the housethanes. $93Is it too late to surprise the warlord Sthovin with an attack?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93It is never too late to attack,$94 said Barif. $93But what of his great armored warriors?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I understand,$94 said Barif's spymaster. $93That his soldiers always wake at dawn.  If we strike an hour before, we can catch them defenseless, before they've had a chance to bathe, let alone don their armor.$94 <BR>
<BR>
$93If we capture their armorer Jnaggo, then we too would know the secrets of blacksmithery,$94 said Barif. $93Let it be done.  We attack tomorrow, an hour before dawn.$94<BR>
<BR>
So it was settled.  The Chimer army marched at night, and swarmed into the Dwemer camp.  They were relying on Chimarvamidium to lead the first wave, but it malfunctioned and began attacking the Chimer's own troops.  Added to that, the Dwemer were fully armored, well-rested, and eager for battle.  The surprise was turned, and most of the high-ranking Chimer, including Karenithil Barif the Beast, were captured.<BR>
<BR>
Though they were too proud to ask, Sthovin explained to them that he had been warned of their attack by a Calling by one of his men.<BR>
<BR>
$93What man of yours is in our camp?$94 sneered Barif.<BR>
<BR>
Chimarvamidium, standing erect by the side of the captured, removed its head.  Within its metal body was Jnaggo, the armorer.<BR>
<BR>
$93A Dwemer child of eight can create a golem,$94 he explained. $93But only a truly great warrior and armorer can pretend to be one.$94<BR>
<BR>
Publisher's Note:<BR>
<BR>
This is one of the few tales in this collection, which can actually be traced to the Dwemer. The wording of the story is quite different from older versions in Aldmeris, but the essence is the same. "Chimarvamidium" may be the Dwemer "Nchmarthurnidamz." This word occurs several times in plans of Dwemer armor and Animunculi, but it's meaning is not known. It is almost certainly not "Hope of the Chimer," however. <BR>
<BR>
The Dwemer were probably the first to use heavy armors. It is important to note how a man dressed in armor could fool many of the Chimer in this story. Also note how the Chimer warriors react. When this story was first told, armor that covered the whole body must have still been uncommon and new, whereas even then, Dwemer creations like golems and centurions were well known.<BR>
<BR>
In a rare scholarly moment, Marobar Sul leaves a few pieces of the original story intact, such as parts of the original line in Aldmeris, "A Dwemer of eight can create a golem, but an eight of Dwemer can become one."<BR>
<BR>
Another aspect of this legend that scholars like myself find interesting is the mention of $93the Calling.$94  In this legend and in others, there is a suggestion that the Dwemer race as a whole had some sort of silent and magickal communication. There are records of the Psijic Order which suggest they, too, share this secret. Whatever the case, there are no documented spells of "calling." The Cyrodiil historian Borgusilus Malier first proposed this as a solution to the disappearance of the Dwemer.  He theorized that in 1E 668, the Dwemer enclaves were called together by one of their powerful philosopher-sorcerers ("Kagrnak" in some documents) to embark on a great journey, one of such sublime profundity that they abandoned all their cities and lands to join the quest to foreign climes as an entire culture.<BR>

The Chimer had great skills in magick and bladery, but against the armored battalions of the Dwemer, clad in the finest shielding wrought by Jnaggo, there was little hope of their ever winning.   In the interests of keeping some measure of peace in the Land, Sthovin the Warlord agreed to a truce with Karenithil Barif the Beast.  In exchange for the Disputed Lands, Sthovin gave Barif a mighty golem, which would protect the Chimer's territory from the excursions of the Northern Barbarians.<BR>
<BR>
Barif was delighted with his gift and brought it back to his camp, where all his warriors gaped in awe at it.  Sparkling gold in hue, it resembled a Dwemer cavalier with a proud aspect.  To test its strength, they placed the golem in the center of an arena and flung magickal bolts of lightning at it.  Its agility was such that few of the bolts struck it.  It had the wherewithal to pivot on its hips to avoid the brunt of the attacks without losing its balance, feet firmly planted on the ground.  A vault of fireballs followed, which the golem ably dodged, bending its knees and its legs to spin around the blasts.  The few times it was struck, it made certain to be hit in the chest and waist, the strongest parts of its body.<BR>
<BR>
The troops cheered at the sight of such an agile and powerful creation.  With it leading the defense, the Barbarians of Skyrim would never again successfully raid their villages.  They named it Chimarvamidium, the Hope of the Chimer.<BR>
<BR>
Barif has the golem brought to his chambers with all his housethanes.  There they tested Chimarvamidium further, its strength, its speed, its resiliency.  They could find no flaw with its design.<BR>
<BR>
$93Imagine when the naked barbarians first meet this on one of their raids,$94 laughed one of the housethanes.<BR>
<BR>
$93It is only unfortunate that it resembles a Dwemer instead of one of our own,$94 mused Karenithil Barif. $93It is revolting to think that they will have a greater respect for our other enemies than us.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I think we should never accepted the peace terms that we did,$94 said another, one of the most aggressive of the housethanes. $93Is it too late to surprise the warlord Sthovin with an attack?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93It is never too late to attack,$94 said Barif. $93But what of his great armored warriors?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I understand,$94 said Barif's spymaster. $93That his soldiers always wake at dawn.  If we strike an hour before, we can catch them defenseless, before they've had a chance to bathe, let alone don their armor.$94 <BR>
<BR>
$93If we capture their armorer Jnaggo, then we too would know the secrets of blacksmithery,$94 said Barif. $93Let it be done.  We attack tomorrow, an hour before dawn.$94<BR>
<BR>
So it was settled.  The Chimer army marched at night, and swarmed into the Dwemer camp.  They were relying on Chimarvamidium to lead the first wave, but it malfunctioned and began attacking the Chimer's own troops.  Added to that, the Dwemer were fully armored, well-rested, and eager for battle.  The surprise was turned, and most of the high-ranking Chimer, including Karenithil Barif the Beast, were captured.<BR>
<BR>
Though they were too proud to ask, Sthovin explained to them that he had been warned of their attack by a Calling by one of his men.<BR>
<BR>
$93What man of yours is in our camp?$94 sneered Barif.<BR>
<BR>
Chimarvamidium, standing erect by the side of the captured, removed its head.  Within its metal body was Jnaggo, the armorer.<BR>
<BR>
$93A Dwemer child of eight can create a golem,$94 he explained. $93But only a truly great warrior and armorer can pretend to be one.$94<BR>
<BR>
Publisher's Note:<BR>
<BR>
This is one of the few tales in this collection, which can actually be traced to the Dwemer. The wording of the story is quite different from older versions in Aldmeris, but the essence is the same. "Chimarvamidium" may be the Dwemer "Nchmarthurnidamz." This word occurs several times in plans of Dwemer armor and Animunculi, but its meaning is not known. It is almost certainly not "Hope of the Chimer," however. <BR>
<BR>
The Dwemer were probably the first to use heavy armors. It is important to note how a man dressed in armor could fool many of the Chimer in this story. Also note how the Chimer warriors react. When this story was first told, armor that covered the whole body must have still been uncommon and new, whereas even then, Dwemer creations like golems and centurions were well known.<BR>
<BR>
In a rare scholarly moment, Marobar Sul leaves a few pieces of the original story intact, such as parts of the original line in Aldmeris, "A Dwemer of eight can create a golem, but an eight of Dwemer can become one."<BR>
<BR>
Another aspect of this legend that scholars like myself find interesting is the mention of $93the Calling.$94  In this legend and in others, there is a suggestion that the Dwemer race as a whole had some sort of silent and magickal communication. There are records of the Psijic Order which suggest they, too, share this secret. Whatever the case, there are no documented spells of "calling." The Cyrodiil historian Borgusilus Malier first proposed this as a solution to the disappearance of the Dwemer.  He theorized that in 1E 668, the Dwemer enclaves were called together by one of their powerful philosopher-sorcerers ("Kagrnak" in some documents) to embark on a great journey, one of such sublime profundity that they abandoned all their cities and lands to join the quest to foreign climes as an entire culture.<BR>

The Thirty-Six Lessons of Vivec: Sermon Twenty<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
The first monster was actually two, having been born twice like his mother-father, Vivec. He was not the mightiest of the eight to escape Muatra, but his actions were the most worrisome. He was known as Moon Axle, and he harvested the leftovers foibles of nature. This he did twice, as was said, and the second harvest always brought ruin or unwritten law. His aspect was faceted like a polyhedron. <BR>
<BR>
No perils are mentioned in the finding of Moon Axle, but it was known that he was immune to spears, so Vivec had to use the sword not held against him. Before he took issue with the monster, the warrior-poet asked:<BR>
<BR>
'How came you to be immune to spears?'<BR>
<BR>
To which Moon Axle replied, 'Mine is a dual nature, and protean. I am in fact made of many straight lines, though none last too long. In this way I have learned to ignore all true segments.'<BR>
<BR>
Luckily, the sword not held was curved and therefore could cut into Moon Axle, and before the sun was up he was bleeding from many wounds. Vivec did not slay him outright for to do so would to keep the foibles of nature within him and not back where they belonged. Soon Vivec had traced geography right again, and Moon Axle was ready to be slain.<BR>
<BR>
Vivec rose up in his giant-form, to be terrible to look upon. He reached into the west and pulled out a canyon, holding it like a horn. He reached east and ate a handful of nix hounds. Blowing their spirits through the canyon made a terrible wail, not unlike an unsolved woman. He said:<BR>
<BR>
'Let this overtake you,' and Moon Axle was overtaken by the curvatures of stolen souls. They wrapped about the monster like resin, until finally he could not move, nor could his dual nature.<BR>
<BR>
Vivec said, 'Now you are solved,' and pierced his child with Muatra. Moon Axle had been reduced to something static, and therefore shattered.<BR>
<BR>
The lines of Moon Axle were collected by Velothi philosophers and taken into caves. There, and for a year, Vivec taught the philosophers how to turn the lines of his son into the spokes of mystery wheels. This was the birth of the first Whirling School. Before, there had only been the surface thought of fire.<BR>
<BR>
Vivec looked at his first wheeling students and observed:<BR>
<BR>
'Alike the egg-layered universe is this morbid possession of three-distant coverage, soul-wrecked and alive, like my name is alive. In this cloister you have discovered one walking path, hilled like a sword but more coarsened. So edged it is that it has to be whispered to keep the tongue from bleeding, where its signs evacuate their former meanings, like empires that tarry too long.<BR>
<BR>
'The sword is estrangement from statesmanship.<BR>
<BR>
'Look on the estimable lines of my son, now crafted star-wise, his every limb equidistant from the center. Is he solved because I will it so? There cannot be a second stage. Think on the theory that my existence promulgates the five elements and alike the egg-layered universe I am cause for great density.

A Dance In Fire, Chapter I <BR>
by Waughin Jarth<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
Scene: The Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>
Date: 7 Frost Fall, 3E 397<BR>
<BR>
It seemed as if the palace had always housed the Atrius Building Commission, the company of clerks and estate agents who authored and notarized nearly every construction of any note in the Empire.  It had stood for two hundred and fifty years, since the reign of the Emperor Magnus, a plain-fronted and austere hall on a minor but respectable plaza in the Imperial City.  Energetic and ambitious middle-class lads and ladies worked there, as well as complacent middle-aged ones like Decumus Scotti.  No one could imagine a world without the Commission, least of all Scotti.  To be accurate, he could not imagine a world without himself in the Commission.<BR>
<BR>
$93Lord Atrius is perfectly aware of your contributions,$94 said the managing clerk, closing the shutter that demarcated Scotti's office behind him. $93But you know that things have been difficult.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes,$94 said Scotti, stiffly.<BR>
<BR>
$93Lord Vanech's men have been giving us a lot of competition lately, and we must be more efficient if we are to survive.  Unfortunately, that means releasing some of our historically best but presently underachieving senior clerks.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I understand.  Can't be helped.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I'm glad that you understand,$94 smiled the managing clerk, smiling thinly and withdrawing. $93Please have your room cleared immediately.$94<BR>
<BR>
Scotti began the task of organizing all his work to pass on to his successor.  It would probably be young Imbrallius who would take most of it on, which was as it should be, he considered philosophically.  The lad knew how to find business.  Scotti wondered idly what the fellow would do with the contracts for the new statue of St Alessia for which the Temple of the One had applied.  Probably invent a clerical error, blame it on his old predecessor Decumus Scotti, and require an additional cost to rectify.<BR>
<BR>
$93I have correspondence for Decumus Scotti of the Atrius Building Commission.$94<BR>
<BR>
Scotti looked up.  A fat-faced courier had entered his office and was thrusting forth a sealed scroll.  He handed the boy a gold piece, and opened it up.  By the poor penmanship, atrocious spelling and grammar, and overall unprofessional tone, it was manifestly evident who the writer was.  Liodes Jurus, a fellow clerk some years before, who had left the Commission after being accused of unethical business practices.  <BR>

$93Dear Sckotti,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I emagine you alway wondered what happened to me, and the last plase you would have expected to find me is out in the woods.  But thats exactly where I am.  Ha ha.  If your'e smart and want to make lot of extra gold for Lord Atrius (and yourself, ha ha), youll come down to Vallinwood too.  If you have'nt or have been following the politics hear lately, you may or may not know that ther's bin a war between the Boshmer and there neighbors Elswere over the past two years.  Things have only just calm down, and ther's a lot that needs to be rebuilt.<BR>
<BR>
Now Ive got more business than I can handel, but I need somone with some clout, someone representing a respected agencie to get the quill in the ink.  That somone is you, my fiend.  Come & meat me at the M'ther Paskos Tavern in Falinnesti, Vallinwood.  Ill be here 2 weeks and you wont be sorrie.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-- Jurus<BR>
<BR>
P.S.: Bring a wagenload of timber if you can.$94<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Magic Cards"><BR>
$93What do you have there, Scotti?$94 asked a voice.<BR>
<BR>
Scotti started.  It was Imbrallius, his damnably handsome face peeking through the shutters, smiling in that way that melted the hearts of the stingiest of patrons and the roughest of stonemasons.  Scotti shoved the letter in his jacket pocket.<BR>
<BR>
$93Personal correspondence,$94 he sniffed. $93I'll be cleared up here in a just a moment.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I don't want to hurry you,$94 said Imbrallius, grabbing a few sheets of blank contracts from Scotti's desk. $93I've just gone through a stack, and the junior scribes hands are all cramping up, so I thought you wouldn't miss a few.$94<BR>
<BR>
The lad vanished.  Scotti retrieved the letter and read it again.  He thought about his life, something he rarely did.  It seemed a sea of gray with a black insurmountable wall looming.  There was only one narrow passage he could see in that wall.  Quickly, before he had a moment to reconsider it, he grabbed a dozen of the blank contracts with the shimmering gold leaf ATRIUS BUILDING COMMISSION BY APPOINTMENT OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY and hid them in the satchel with his personal effects.<BR>
<BR>
The next day he began his adventure with a giddy lack of hesitation.   He arranged for a seat in a caravan bound for Valenwood, the single escorted conveyance to the southeast leaving the Imperial City that week.  He had scarcely hours to pack, but he remembered to purchase a wagonload of timber.<BR>
<BR>
$93It will be extra gold to pay for a horse to pull that,$94 frowned the convoy head.<BR>
<BR>
$93So I anticipated,$94 smiled Scotti with his best Imbrallius grin.<BR>
<BR>
Ten wagons in all set off that afternoon through the familiar Cyrodilic countryside.  Past fields of wildflowers, gently rolling woodlands, friendly hamlets.  The clop of the horses' hooves against the sound stone road reminded Scotti that the Atrius Building Commission constructed it.  Five of the eighteen necessary contracts for its completion were drafted by his own hand.<BR>
<BR>
$93Very smart of you to bring that wood along,$94 said a gray-whiskered Breton man next to him on his wagon. $93You must be in Commerce.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Of a sort,$94 said Scotti, in a way he hoped was mysterious, before introducing himself: $93Decumus Scotti.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Gryf Mallon,$94 said the man.  $93I'm a poet, actually a translator of old Bosmer literature.  I was researching some newly discovered tracts of the Mnoriad Pley Bar two years ago when the war broke out and I had to leave.  You are no doubt familiar with the Mnoriad, if you're aware of the Green Pact.$94<BR>
<BR>
Scotti thought the man might be speaking perfect gibberish, but he nodded his head.<BR>
<BR>
$93Naturally, I don't pretend that the Mnoriad is as renowned as the Meh Ayleidion, or as ancient as the Dansir Gol, but I think it has a remarkable significance to understanding the nature of the merelithic Bosmer mind.  The origin of the Wood Elf aversion to cutting their own wood or eating any plant material at all, yet paradoxically their willingness to import plantstuff from other cultures, I feel can be linked to a passage in the Mnoriad,$94 Mallon shuffled through some of his papers, searching for the appropriate text.<BR>
<BR>
To Scotti's vast relief, the carriage soon stopped to camp for the night.  They were high on a bluff over a gray stream, and before them was the great valley of Valenwood.  Only the cry of seabirds declared the presence of the ocean to the bay to the west: here the timber was so tall and wide, twisting around itself like an impossible knot begun eons ago, to be impenetrable.  A few more modest trees, only fifty feet to the lowest branches, stood on the cliff at the edge of camp.   The sight was so alien to Scotti and he found himself so anxious about the proposition of entering the wilderness that he could not imagine sleeping.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, Mallon had supposed he had found another academic with a passion for the riddles of ancient cultures.  Long into the night, he recited Bosmer verse in the original and in his own translation, sobbing and bellowing and whispering wherever appropriate.  Gradually, Scotti began to feel drowsy, but a sudden crack of wood snapping made him sit straight up.<BR>
<BR>
$93What was that?$94<BR>
<BR>
Mallon smiled: $93I like it too. 'Convocation in the malignity of the moonless speculum, a dance of fire --'$94<BR>
<BR>
$93There are some enormous birds up in the trees moving around,$94 whispered Scotti, pointing in the direction of the dark shapes above.<BR>
<BR>
$93I wouldn't worry about that,$94 said Mallon, irritated with his audience. $93Now listen to how the poet characterizes Herma-Mora's invocation in the eighteenth stanza of the fourth book.$94<BR>
<BR>
The dark shapes in the trees were some of them perched like birds, others slithered like snakes, and still others stood up straight like men.  As Mallon recited his verse, Scotti watched the figures softly leap from branch to branch, half-gliding across impossible distances for anything without wings.  They gathered in groups and then reorganized until they had spread to every tree around the camp.  Suddenly they plummeted from the heights.<BR>
<BR>
$93Mara!$94 cried Scotti. $93They're falling like rain!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Probably seed pods,$94 Mallon shrugged, not turning around. $93Some of the trees have remarkable --$94<BR>
<BR>
The camp erupted into chaos.  Fires burst out in the wagons, the horses wailed from mortal blows, casks of wine, fresh water, and liquor gushed their contents to the ground.  A nimble shadow dashed past Scotti and Mallon, gathering sacks of grain and gold with impossible agility and grace.  Scotti had only one glance at it, lit up by a sudden nearby burst of flame.  It was a sleek creature with pointed ears, wide yellow eyes, mottled pied fur and a tail like a whip.<BR>
<BR>
$93Werewolf,$94 he whimpered, shrinking back.<BR>
<BR>
$93Cathay-raht,$94 groaned Mallon. $93Much worse.  Khajiti cousins or some such thing, come to plunder.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Are you sure?$94<BR>
<BR>
As quickly as they struck, the creatures retreated, diving off the bluff before the battlemage and knight, the caravan's escorts, had fully opened their eyes.  Mallon and Scotti ran to the precipice and saw a hundred feet below the tiny figures dash out of the water, shake themselves, and disappear into the wood.<BR>
<BR>
$93Werewolves aren't acrobats like that,$94 said Mallon. $93They were definitely Cathay-raht.  Bastard thieves.  Thank Stendarr they didn't realize the value of my notebooks.  It wasn't a complete loss.$94<BR>

$93Naturally, I don't pretend that the Mnoriad is as renowned as the Meh Ayleidion, or as ancient as the Dansir Gol, but I think it has a remarkable significance to understanding the nature of the merelithic Bosmer mind.  The origin of the Wood Elf aversion to cutting their own wood or eating any plant material at all, yet paradoxically their willingness to import plantstuff from other cultures, I feel can be linked to a passage in the Mnoriad,$94 Mallon shuffled through some of his papers, searching for the appropriate text.<BR>
<BR>
To Scotti's vast relief, the carriage soon stopped to camp for the night.  They were high on a bluff over a gray stream, and before them was the great valley of Valenwood.  Only the cry of seabirds declared the presence of the ocean to the bay to the west: here the timber was so tall and wide, twisting around itself like an impossible knot begun eons ago, to be impenetrable.  A few more modest trees, only fifty feet to the lowest branches, stood on the cliff at the edge of camp.   The sight was so alien to Scotti and he found himself so anxious about the proposition of entering the wilderness that he could not imagine sleeping.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, Mallon had supposed he had found another academic with a passion for the riddles of ancient cultures.  Long into the night, he recited Bosmer verse in the original and in his own translation, sobbing and bellowing and whispering wherever appropriate.  Gradually, Scotti began to feel drowsy, but a sudden crack of wood snapping made him sit straight up.<BR>
<BR>
$93What was that?$94<BR>
<BR>
Mallon smiled: $93I like it too. 'Convocation in the malignity of the moonless speculum, a dance of fire --'$94<BR>
<BR>
$93There are some enormous birds up in the trees moving around,$94 whispered Scotti, pointing in the direction of the dark shapes above.<BR>
<BR>
$93I wouldn't worry about that,$94 said Mallon, irritated with his audience. $93Now listen to how the poet characterizes Herma-Mora's invocation in the eighteenth stanza of the fourth book.$94<BR>
<BR>
The dark shapes in the trees were some of them perched like birds, others slithered like snakes, and still others stood up straight like men.  As Mallon recited his verse, Scotti watched the figures softly leap from branch to branch, half-gliding across impossible distances for anything without wings.  They gathered in groups and then reorganized until they had spread to every tree around the camp.  Suddenly they plummeted from the heights.<BR>
<BR>
$93Mara!$94 cried Scotti. $93They're falling like rain!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Probably seed pods,$94 Mallon shrugged, not turning around. $93Some of the trees have remarkable --$94<BR>
<BR>
The camp erupted into chaos.  Fires burst out in the wagons, the horses wailed from mortal blows, casks of wine, fresh water, and liquor gushed their contents to the ground.  A nimble shadow dashed past Scotti and Mallon, gathering sacks of grain and gold with impossible agility and grace.  Scotti had only one glance at it, lit up by a sudden nearby burst of flame.  It was a sleek creature with pointed ears, wide yellow eyes, mottled pied fur and a tail like a whip.<BR>
<BR>
$93Werewolf,$94 he whimpered, shrinking back.<BR>
<BR>
$93Cathay-raht,$94 groaned Mallon. $93Much worse.  Khajiiti cousins or some such thing, come to plunder.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Are you sure?$94<BR>
<BR>
As quickly as they struck, the creatures retreated, diving off the bluff before the battlemage and knight, the caravan's escorts, had fully opened their eyes.  Mallon and Scotti ran to the precipice and saw a hundred feet below the tiny figures dash out of the water, shake themselves, and disappear into the wood.<BR>
<BR>
$93Werewolves aren't acrobats like that,$94 said Mallon. $93They were definitely Cathay-raht.  Bastard thieves.  Thank Stendarr they didn't realize the value of my notebooks.  It wasn't a complete loss.$94<BR>

The Wolf Queen, Book Two<BR>
by Waughin Jarth<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
From the pen of the first century third era sage Montocai:<BR>
<FONT COLOR="640F0F" SIZE="3" FACE="Magic Cards"><BR>
3E 82:<BR>
A year after the wedding of his 14-year-old granddaughter the Princess Potema to King Mantiarco of the Nordic kingdom of Solitude, the Emperor Uriel Septim II passed on.  His son Pelagius Septim II was made emperor, and he faced a greatly depleted treasury, thanks to his father's poor management.<BR>
<BR>
As the new Queen of Solitude, Potema faced opposition from the old Nordic houses, who viewed her as an outsider.  Mantiarco had been widowed, and his former queen was loved.  She had left him a son, Prince Bathorgh, who was two years older than his stepmother, and loved her not.  But the king loved his queen, and suffered with her through miscarriage after miscarriage, until her 29th year, when she bore him a son.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Magic Cards"><BR>
<BR>
3E 97<BR>
$93You must do something to help the pain!$94 Potema cried, baring her teeth.  The healer Kelmeth immediately thought of a she-wolf in labor, but he put the image from his mind.  Her enemies called her the Wolf Queen for certes, but not because of any physical resemblance.<BR>
<BR>
$93Your Majesty, there is no injury for me to heal.  The pain you feel is natural and helpful for the birth,$94 he was going to add more words of consolation, but he had to break off to duck the mirror she flung at him.<BR>
<BR>
$93I'm not a pignosed peasant girl!$94 She snarled, $93I am the Queen of Solitude, daughter of the Emperor!  Summon the daedra!  I'll trade the soul of every last subject of mine for a little comfort!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My Lady,$94 said the healer nervously, drawing the curtains and blotting out the cold morning sun. $93It is not wise to make such offers even in jest.  The eyes of Oblivion are forever watching for just such a rash interjection.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What would you know of Oblivion, healer?$94 she growled, but her voice was calmer, quieter.  The pain had relaxed.  $93Would you fetch me that mirror I hurled at you?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Are you going to throw it again, your Majesty?$94 said the healer with a taut smile, obeying her.<BR>
<BR>
$93Very likely,$94 she said, looking at her reflection. $93And next time I won't miss.  But I do look a fright.  Is Lord Vhokken still waiting for me in the hall?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, your Majesty.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Well, tell him I just need to fix my hair and I'll be with him.  And leave us.  I'll howl for you when the pain returns.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, your Majesty.$94<BR>
<BR>
A few minutes later, Lord Vhokken was shown into the chamber.  He was an enormous bald man whose friends and enemies called Mount Vhokken, and when he spoke it was with the low grumble of thunder.  The Queen was one of the very few people Vhokken knew who was not the least bit intimidated by him, and he offered her a smile.<BR>
<BR>
$93My queen, how are you feeling?$94 he asked.<BR>
<BR>
$93Damned.  But you're looking like Springtide has come to Mount Vhokken.  I take it from your merry disposition that you've been made warchief.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Only temporarily, while your husband the King investigates whether there is evidence behind the rumors of treason on the part of my predecessor Lord Thone.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93If you've planted it as I've instructed, he'll find it,$94 Potema smiled, propping herself up in the bed. $93Tell me, is Prince Bathorgh still in the city?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What a question, your highness,$94 laughed the mountain. $93It's the Tournament of Stamina today, you know the prince would never miss that.  The fellow invents new strategies of self-defense every year to show off during the games.  Don't you recall last year, where he entered the ring unarmored and after twenty minutes of fending off six bladesmen, left the games without a scratch?  He dedicated that bout to his late mother, Queen Amodetha.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, I recall.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93He's no friend to me or you, your highness, but you must give the man his due respect. He moves like lightning.  You wouldn't think it of him, but he always seems to use his awkwardness to his advantage, to throw his opponents off.  Some say he learned the style from the orcs to the south.  They say he learned from them how to anticipate a foe's attack by some sort of supernatural power.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93There's nothing supernatural about it,$94 said the Queen, quietly. $93He gets it from his father.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Mantiarco never moved like that,$94 Vhokken chuckled.<BR>
<BR>
$93I never said he did,$94 said Potema.  Her eyes closed and her teeth gritted together. $93The pain's returning.  You must fetch the healer, but first, I must ask you one other thing -- has the new summer palace construction begun?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I think so, your Highness.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Do not think!$94 she cried, gripping the sheets, biting her lips so a stream of blood dripped down her chin. $93Do!  Make certain that the construction begins at once, today!  Your future, my future, and the future of this child depend on it!  Go!$94<BR>
<BR>
Four hours later, King Mantiarco entered the room to see his son.  His queen smiled weakly as he gave her a kiss on the forehead.  When she handed him the child, a tear ran down his face.  Another one quickly followed, and then another.<BR>
<BR>
$93My Lord,$94 she said fondly. $93I know you're sentimental, but really!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93It's not only the child, though he is beautiful, with all the fair features of his mother,$94 Mantiarco turned to his wife, sadly, his aged features twisted in agony. $93My dear wife, there is trouble at the palace.  In truth, this birth is the only thing that keeps this day from being the darkest in my reign.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What is it?  Something at the tournament?$94 Potema pulled herself up in bed. $93Something with Bathorgh?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93No, it's isn't the tournament, but it does relate to Bathorgh.  I shouldn't worry you at a time like this.  You need your rest.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My husband, tell me!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I wanted to surprise you with a gift after the birth of our child, so I had the old summer palace completely renovated.  It's a beautiful place, or at least it was.  I thought you might like it.  Truth to tell, it was Lord Vhokken idea.  It used to be Amodetha's favorite place.$94  Bitterness crept into the king's voice. $93Now I've learned why.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What have you learned?$94 asked Potema quietly.<BR>
<BR>
$93Amodetha deceived me there, with my trusted warchief, Lord Thone.  There were letters between them, the most perverse things you've ever read.  And that's not the worst of it.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93No?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93The dates on the letters correspond with the time of Bathorgh's birth.  The boy I raised and loved as a son,$94 Mantiarco's voice choked up with emotion. $93He was Thone's child, not mine.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My darling,$94 said Potema, almost feeling sorry for the old man.  She wrapped her arms around his neck, as he heaved his sobs down on her and their child.<BR>
<BR>
$93Henceforth,$94 he said quietly. $93Bathorgh is no longer my heir.  He will be banished from the kingdom.  This child you have borne me today will grow to rule Solitude.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93And perhaps more,$94 said Potema. $93He is the Emperor's grandson as well.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93We will name him Mantiarco the Second.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My darling, I would love that,$94 said Potema, kissing the king's tear-streaked face. $93But may I suggest Uriel, after my grandfather the Emperor, who brought us together in marriage?$94<BR>
<BR>
King Mantiarco smiled at his wife and nodded his head.  There was a knock at the door.<BR>
<BR>
$93My liege,$94 said Mount Vhokken. $93His highness Prince Bathorgh has finished the tournament and awaits you to present his award.  He has successfully withstood attacks by nine archers and the giant scorpion we brought in from Hammerfell.  The crowd is roaring his name.  They are calling him The Man Who Cannot Be Hit.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I will see him,$94 said King Mantiarco sadly, and left the chamber.<BR>
<BR>
$93Oh he can be hit, all right,$94 said Potema wearily. $93But it does take some doing.$94<BR>
<BR>

Varieties of Faith in the Empire<BR>
by Brother Mikhael Karkuxor of the Imperial College<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
This is my best attempt at a listing of the pantheons and associated divine spirits of Tamriel's dominant cultures. This list is by no means complete (the Imperial City of Cyrodiil alone boasts a vast host of saints and holy spirits). It only includes the most important spirits revered by native members of the culture. Other et'Ada, especially Daedra, are often familiar known to many cultures, though specific names are included here only when they possess a particular cultural significance. The omission of any reference to the worships of the Argonians of Black Marsh is a result of my complete inadequacy in reconciling the obscure and contradictory accounts available to me on that subject.<BR>

<BR>
NOTES ON THE DIVINE SPIRITS OF THE PANTHEONS<BR>
<BR>
Akatosh (Dragon God of Time): Akatosh is the chief deity of the Nine Divines (the major religious cult of Cyrodiil and its provinces), and one of two deities found in every Tamrielic religion (the other is Lorkhan). He is generally considered to be the first of the Gods to form in the Beginning Place; after his establishment, other spirits found the process of being easier and the various pantheons of the world emerged. He is the ultimate God of the Cyrodilic Empire, where he embodies the qualities of endurance, invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy. <BR>
<BR>
Alduin (World Eater): Alduin is the Nordic variation of Akatosh, and only superficially resembles his counterpart in the Nine Divines. For example, Alduin's sobriquet, 'the world eater', comes from myths that depict him as the horrible, ravaging firestorm that destroyed the last world to begin this one. Nords therefore see the god of time as both creator and harbinger of the apocalypse. He is not the chief of the Nordic pantheon (in fact, that pantheon has no chief; see Shor, below) but its wellspring, albeit a grim and frightening one.<BR>
<BR>
Alkosh (Dragon King of Cats): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity. A variation on the Altmeri Auri-El, and thus an Akatosh-as-culture-hero for the earliest Khajiiti. His worship was co-opted during the establishment of the Riddle-T'har, and he still enjoys immense popularity in Elsweyr's wasteland regions. He is depicted as a fearsome dragon, a creature the Khajiit say 'is just a real big cat'. He repelled an early Aldmeri pogrom of Pelinal Whitestrake during mythic times.<BR>
<BR>
Almalexia (Mother Morrowind): Most traces of Akatosh disappeared from ancient Chimer legends during their so-called 'exodus', primarily due to that god's association and esteem with the Altmeri. However, most aspects of Akatosh which seem so important to the mortal races, namely immortality, historicity, and genealogy, have conveniently resurfaced in Almalexia, the most popular of Morrowind's divine Tribunal.<BR>
<BR>
Arkay (God of the Cycle of Life and Death):  Member of the Nine Divines pantheon, and popular elsewhere as well. Arkay is often more important in those cultures where his father, Akatosh, is either less related to time or where his time aspects are difficult to comprehend by the layman. He is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. It is said that Arkay did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God. <BR>
<BR>
Auri-El (King of the Aldmer): The Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of Anui-El, who, in turn, is the soul of Anu the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most Altmeri and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.<BR>
<BR>
Azura (Goddess of Dusk and Dawn): Azura was the god-ancestor that taught the Chimer the mysteries needed to be different than the Altmer. Some of her more conventional teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often more a communal cosmic force for the race as a whole than an ancestor or a god. Also known as the Anticipation of Sotha Sil. In Elsweyr, Azurah is nearly a wholly separate entity, yet she is still tied into the origins of Khajiiti out of Altmeri stock.<BR>
<BR>
Baan Dar (The Bandit God): In most regions, Baan Dar is a marginal diety, a trickster spirit of thieves and beggars. In Elsweyr he is more important, and is regarded as the Pariah. In this aspect, Baan Dar becomes the cleverness or desperate genius of the long-suffering Khajiit, whose last minute plans always upset the machinations of their (Elven or Human) enemies.  <BR>
<BR>
Boethiah (Prince of Plots): Heralded by the Prophet Veloth, Boethiah is the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his illuminations, the eventual 'Chimer', or Changed Folk, renounced all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric principles. All manner of Dark Elven cultural 'advances' are attributed to Boethiah, from philosophy to magic to 'responsible' architecture. Ancient Velothi allegories are uniformly heroic successes of Boethiah over enemies of every type, foundation stories of Chimeri struggle. Also known as the Anticipation of Almalexia. <BR>
<BR>
Diagna (Orichalc God of the Sideways Blade): Hoary thuggish cult of the Redguards. Originated in Yokuda during the Twenty Seven Snake Folk Slaughter. Diagna was an avatar of the HoonDing (the Yokudan God of Make Way, see below) that achieved permanence. He was instrumental to the defeat of the Lefthanded Elves, as he brought orichalc weapons to the Yokudan people to win the fight. In Tamriel, he led a very tight knit group of followers against the Orcs of Orsinium during the height of their ancient power, but then faded into obscurity. He is now little more than a local power spirit of the Dragontail mountains.<BR>
<BR>
Dibella (Goddess of Beauty): Popular god of the Nine Divines. In Cyrodiil, she has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction. <BR>
<BR>
Herma-Mora (The Woodland Man): Ancient Atmoran demon who, at one time, nearly seduced the Nords into becoming Aldmer. Most Ysgramor myths are about escaping the wiles of old Herma-Mora. Also called the Demon of Knowledge, he is vaguely related to the cult origins of the Morag Tong ('Foresters Guild'), if only by association with his brother/sister, Mephala. <BR>
<BR>
HoonDing (The Make Way God): Yokudan spirit of 'perseverance over infidels'. The HoonDing has historically materialized whenever the Redguards need to 'make way' for their people. In Tamrielic history this has only happened three times -- twice in the first era during the Ra Gada invasion and once during the Tiber War. In this last incarnation, the HoonDing was said to have been either a sword or a crown, or both.<BR>
<BR>
Jhunal (Rune God): The Nordic god of hermetic orders. After falling out of favor with the rest of that pantheon, he became Julianos of the Nine Divines. He is absent in modern Skyrim mythology. <BR>
<BR>
Jode (Big Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Big Moon. Also called Masser or Mara's Tear. In Khajiti religion, Jode is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.<BR>
<BR>
Jone (Little Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Little Moon. Also called Secunda or Stendarr's Sorrow. In Khajiti religion, Jone is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.<BR>
<BR>
Julianos (God of Wisdom and Logic): Often associated with Jhunal, the Nordic father of language and mathematics, Julianos is the Cyrodilic god of literature, law, history, and contradiction. Monastic orders founded by Tiber Septim and dedicated to Julianos are the keepers of the Elder Scrolls. <BR>
<BR>
Kyne (Kiss At the End): Nordic Goddess of the Storm. Widow of Shor and favored god of warriors. She is often called the Mother of Men. Her daughters taught the first Nords the use of the thu'um, or Storm Voice.<BR>
<BR>
Kynareth (Goddess of Air): Kynareth is a member of the Nine Divines, the strongest of the Sky spirits. In some legends, she is the first to agree to Lorkhan's plan to invent the mortal plane, and provides the space for its creation in the void. She is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhan's divine spark.<BR>
<BR>
Leki (Saint of the Spirit Sword): Goddess daughter of Tall Papa, Leki is the goddess of aberrant swordsmanship. The Na-Totambu of Yokuda warred to a standstill during the mythic era to decide who would lead the charge against the Lefthanded Elves. Their swordmasters, though, were so skilled in the Best Known Cuts as to be matched evenly. Leki introduced the Ephemeral Feint. Afterwards, a victor emerged and the war with the Aldmer began.<BR>
<BR>
Lorkhan (The Missing God): This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri 'Lorkhan', or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo -- much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the 'scheme of things' is interpreted a variety of ways. In Morrowind, for example, he is a being related to the Psijiic Endeavor, a process by which mortals are charged with transcending the gods that created them. To the High Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind.<BR>
<BR>
Lorkhaj (Moon Beast): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity, easily identified with the Missing God, Lorkhan. <BR>
<BR>
Magnus (Magus): The god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What is left of him on the world is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff. Cyrodilic legends say he can inhabit the bodies of powerful magicians and lend them his power. Associated with Zurin Arctus, the Underking.<BR>
<BR>
Malacath (God of Curses): Malacath is the reanimated dung that was Trinimac. A somewhat weak but vengeful Daedra, the Dark Elves say he is also Malak, the god-king of the orcs. He always tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.<BR>
<BR>
Malooc (Horde King): An enemy god of the Ra Gada. Led the goblins against the Redguards during the first era. Fled east when the army of the HoonDing overtook his goblin hordes.<BR>
<BR>
Mauloch (Malacath): An Orcish god, Mauloch troubled the heirs of King Harald for a long time. Fled east after his defeat at the Battle of Dragon Wall, ca. 1E660. His rage was said to fill the sky with his sulphurous hatred, later called the "Year of Winter in Summer".<BR>
<BR>
Mara (Goddess of Love): Nearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. In Skyrim, Mara is a handmaiden of Kyne. In the Empire, she is Mother-Goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the 'Anuad', the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. Depending on the religion, she is either married to Akatosh or Lorkhan, or the concubine of both.<BR>
<BR>
Mehrunes Dagon (God of Destruction): Popular Daedric power. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. In some cultures, though, Dagon is merely a god of bloodshed and betrayal. He is an especially important deity in Morrowind, where he represents its near-inhospitable terrain. <BR>
<BR>
Mephala (Androgyne):  Mephala is the Webspinner, or the Spider God. In Morrowind, he/she was the ancestor that taught the Chimer the skills they would need to evade their enemies or to kill them with secret murder. Enemies were numerous in those days since the Chimer were a small faction. He/she, along with Boethiah, organized the clan systems that eventually became the basis for the Great Houses. He/she founded the Morag Tong. Also called the Anticipation of Vivec. <BR>
<BR>
Molag Bal (God of Schemes, King of Rape): Daedric power of much importance in Morrowind. There, he is always the archenemy of Boethiah, the Prince of Plots. He is the main source of the obstacles to the Dunmer (and preceding Chimer) people. In the legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of Houses or otherwise ruin Dunmeri 'purity'. A race of supermonsters, said to live in Molag Amur, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.<BR>
<BR>
Morihaus (First Breath of Man): Ancient cultural hero god of the Cyro-Nordics. Legend portrays him as the Taker of the Citadel, an act of mythic times that established Human control over the Valley Heartland. He is often associated with the Nordic powers of thu'um, and therefore with Kynareth.<BR>
<BR>
Morwha (Teat God): Yokudan fertility goddess. Fundamental deity in the Yokudan pantheon, and the favorite of Tall Papa's wives. Still worshipped in various areas of Hammerfell, including Stros M'kai. Morwha is always portrayed as four-armed, so that she can 'grab more husbands'.<BR>
<BR>
Nerevar (Godkiller): The Chimeri king of Resdayn, the Golden Age of old Veloth. Slain during the Battle of Red Mountain, Nerevar was the Herald of the Triune Way, and is the foremost of the saints of Dunmeri faith. He is said to have killed Dumac, the Last Dwarven King, and feasted on his heart.<BR>
<BR>
Onsi (Boneshaver): Notable warrior god of the Yokudan Ra Gada, Onsi taught Mankind how to pull their knives into swords.<BR>
<BR>
Orkey (Old Knocker): A loan-god of the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during Aldmeri rule of Atmora. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that 'bound them to the count of winters'. At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Shor showed up, though, and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.<BR>
<BR>
Phynaster: Hero-god of the Summerset Isles, who taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride.<BR>
<BR>
Rajhin (Footpad): Thief god of the Khajiiti, who grew up in the Black Kiergo section of Senchal. The most famous burglar in Elsweyr's history, Rajhin is said to have stolen a tattoo from the neck of Empress Kintyra as she slept.<BR>
<BR>
Reman (The Cyrodiil): Culture god-hero of the Second Empire, Reman was the greatest hero of the Akaviri Trouble. Indeed, he convinced the invaders to help him build his own empire, and conquered all of Tamriel except for Morrowind. He instituted the rites of becoming Emperor, which included the ritual geas to the Amulet of Kings, a soulgem of immense power. His Dynasty was ended by the Dunmeri Morag Tong at the end of the first era. Also called the Worldly God.<BR>
<BR>
Riddle'Thar (Two-Moons Dance): The cosmic order deity of the Khajiiti, the Riddle'Thar was revealed to Elsweyr by the prophet Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, the Mane. The Riddle'Thar is more a set of guidelines by which to live than a single entity, but some of his avatars like to appear as humble messengers of the gods. Also known as the Sugar God.<BR>
<BR>
Ruptga (Tall Papa): Chief deity of the Yokudan pantheon. Ruptga, more commonly 'Tall Papa', was the first god to figure out how to survive the Hunger of Satakal. Following his lead, the other gods learned the 'Walkabout', or a process by which they can persist beyond one lifetime. Tall Papa set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, too. When there were too many spirits to keep track of, though, Ruptga created a helper out the dead skin of past worlds. This helper is Sep (see below), who later creates the world of mortals.<BR>
<BR>
Satakal (The Worldskin): Yokudan god of everything. A fusion of the concepts of Anu and Padomay. Basically, Satakal is much like the Nordic Alduin, who destroys one world to begin the next. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately become the Yokudan pantheon. Popular god of the Alik'r nomads.<BR>
<BR>
Sheogorath (The Mad God): The fearful obeisance of Sheogorath is widespread, and is found in most Tamrielic quarters. Contemporary sources indicate that his roots are in Aldmeri creation stories; therein, he is 'born' when Lorkhan's divine spark is removed. One crucial myth calls him the 'Sithis-shaped hole' of the world. <BR>
<BR>
Sheor (Bad Man): In Bretony, the Bad Man is the source of all strife. He seems to have started as the god of crop failure, but most modern theologians agree that he is a demonized version of the Nordic Shor, born during the dark years after the fall of Saarthal.<BR>
<BR>
Sep (The Snake): Yokudan version of Lorkhan. Sep is born when Tall Papa creates someone to help him regulate the spirit trade. Sep, though, is driven crazy by the hunger of Satakal, and he convinces some of the gods to help him make an easier alternative to the Walkabout. This, of course, is the world as we know it, and the spirits who followed Sep become trapped here, to live out their lives as mortals. Sep is punished by Tall Papa for his transgressions, but his hunger lives on as a void in the stars, a 'non-space' that tries to upset mortal entry into the Far Shores.<BR>
<BR>
Shezarr (God of Man): Cyrodilic version of Lorkhan, whose importance suffers when Akatosh comes to the fore of Imperial (really, Alessian) religion. Shezarr was the spirit behind all human undertaking, especially against Aldmeri aggression. He is sometimes associated with the founding of the first Cyrodilic battlemages. In the present age of racial tolerance, Shezarr is all but forgotten.<BR>
<BR>
Shor (God of the Underworld): Nordic version of Lorkhan, who takes sides with Men after the creation of the world. Foreign gods (i.e., Elven ones) conspire against him and bring about his defeat, dooming him to the underworld. Atmoran myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior king who leads the Nords to victory over their Aldmeri oppressors time and again. Before his doom, Shor was the chief of the gods. Sometimes also called Children's God (see Orkey, above).<BR>
<BR>
Sotha Sil (Mystery of Morrowind): God of the Dunmer, Sotha Sil is the least known of the divine Tribunal. He is said to be reshaping the world from his hidden, clockwork city.<BR>
<BR>
Stendarr (God of Mercy): God of the Nine Divines, Stendarr has evolved from his Nordic origins into a deity of compassion or, sometimes, righteous rule. He is said to have accompanied Tiber Septim in his later years. In early Altmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.<BR>
<BR>
Stuhn (God of Ransom): Nordic precursor to Stendarr, brother of Tsun. Shield-thane of Shor, Stuhn was a warrior god that fought against the Aldmeri pantheon. He showed Men how to take, and the benefits of taking, prisoners of war.<BR>
<BR>
Syrabane (Warlock's God): An Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided Bendu Olo in the Fall of the Sload. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the Thrassian Plague. He is also called the Apprentices' God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the Mages Guild.<BR>
<BR>
Tava (Bird God): Yokudan spirit of the air. Tava is most famous for leading the Yokudans to the isle of Herne after the destruction of their homeland. She has since become assimilated into the mythology of Kynareth. She is still very popular in Hammerfell among sailors, and her shrines can be found in most port cities.<BR>
<BR>
Tiber Septim (Talos, the Dragonborn): Heir to the Seat of Sundered Kings, Tiber Septim is the most important hero-god of Mankind. He conquered all of Tamriel and ushered in the Third Era (and the Third Empire). Also called Ysmir, 'Dragon of the North'.<BR>
<BR>
Trinimac: Strong god of the early Aldmer, in some places more popular than Auri-El. He was a warrior spirit of the original Elven tribes that led armies against the Men. Boethiah is said to have assumed his shape (in some stories, he even eats Trinimac) so that he could convince a throng of Aldmer to listen to him, which led to their eventual Chimeri conversion. He vanishes from the mythic stage after this, to return as the dread Malacath (Altmeri propaganda portrays this as the dangers of Dunmeri influence).<BR>
<BR>
Tsun: Extinct Nordic god of trials against adversity. Died defending Shor from foreign gods.<BR>
<BR>
Tu'whacca (Tricky God): Yokudan god of souls. Tu'whacca, before the creation of the world, was the god of Nobody Really Cares. When Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout, Tu'whacca found a purpose; he became the caretaker of the Far Shores, and continues to help Redguards find their way into the afterlife. His cult is sometimes associated with Arkay in the more cosmopolitan regions of Hammerfell.<BR>
<BR>
Vivec (Master of Morrowind): Warrior-poet god of the Dunmer. Vivec is the invisible keeper of the holy land, ever vigilant against the dark gods of the Volcano. He/she has saved the Dunmeri people from certain death on numerous occasions, most notably when he/she taught them how to breathe water for a day so that he/she could flood Morrowind and kill the Akaviri invaders, ca. 2E572.<BR>
<BR>
Xarxes: Xarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to Auri-El, and has kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments, large and small, since the beginning of time. He created his wife, Oghma, from his favorite moments in history.<BR>
Y'ffre (God of the Forest): Most important deity of the Bosmeri pantheon. While Auri-El Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere Y'ffre as the spirit of 'the now'. According to the Wood Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the Ehlnofey, or 'Earth Bones'. After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it. Y'ffre is sometimes called the Storyteller, for the lessons he taught the first Bosmer. Some Bosmer still possess the knowledge of the chaos times, which they can use to great effect (the Wild Hunt). <BR>
<BR>
Ysmir (Dragon of the North): The Nordic aspect of Talos. He withstood the power of the Greybeards' voices long enough to hear their prophecy. Later, many Nords could not look on him without seeing a dragon.<BR>
<BR>
Z'en (God of Toil): Bosmeri god of payment in kind. Studies indicate origins in both Argonian and Akaviri mythologies, perhaps introduced into Valenwood by Kothringi sailors. Ostensibly an agriculture deity, Z'en sometimes proves to be an entity of a much higher cosmic order. His worship died out shortly after the Knhaten Flu.<BR>
<BR>
Zeht (God of Farms): Yokudan god of agriculture. Renounced his father after the world was created, which is why Tall Papa makes it so hard to grow food.<BR>
<BR>
Zenithar (God of Work and Commerce, Trader God): Member of the Nine Divines, Zenithar is understandably associated with Z'en. In the Empire, however, he is a far more cultivated god of merchants and middle nobility. His worshippers say, despite his mysterious origins, Zenithar is the god 'that will always win'.<BR>

<BR>
NOTES ON THE DIVINE SPIRITS OF THE PANTHEONS<BR>
<BR>
Akatosh (Dragon God of Time): Akatosh is the chief deity of the Nine Divines (the major religious cult of Cyrodiil and its provinces), and one of two deities found in every Tamrielic religion (the other is Lorkhan). He is generally considered to be the first of the Gods to form in the Beginning Place; after his establishment, other spirits found the process of being easier and the various pantheons of the world emerged. He is the ultimate God of the Cyrodilic Empire, where he embodies the qualities of endurance, invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy. <BR>
<BR>
Alduin (World Eater): Alduin is the Nordic variation of Akatosh, and only superficially resembles his counterpart in the Nine Divines. For example, Alduin's sobriquet, 'the world eater', comes from myths that depict him as the horrible, ravaging firestorm that destroyed the last world to begin this one. Nords therefore see the god of time as both creator and harbinger of the apocalypse. He is not the chief of the Nordic pantheon (in fact, that pantheon has no chief; see Shor, below) but its wellspring, albeit a grim and frightening one.<BR>
<BR>
Alkosh (Dragon King of Cats): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity. A variation on the Altmeri Auri-El, and thus an Akatosh-as-culture-hero for the earliest Khajiiti. His worship was co-opted during the establishment of the Riddle-T'har, and he still enjoys immense popularity in Elsweyr's wasteland regions. He is depicted as a fearsome dragon, a creature the Khajiit say 'is just a real big cat'. He repelled an early Aldmeri pogrom of Pelinal Whitestrake during mythic times.<BR>
<BR>
Almalexia (Mother Morrowind): Most traces of Akatosh disappeared from ancient Chimer legends during their so-called 'exodus', primarily due to that god's association and esteem with the Altmeri. However, most aspects of Akatosh which seem so important to the mortal races, namely immortality, historicity, and genealogy, have conveniently resurfaced in Almalexia, the most popular of Morrowind's divine Tribunal.<BR>
<BR>
Arkay (God of the Cycle of Life and Death):  Member of the Nine Divines pantheon, and popular elsewhere as well. Arkay is often more important in those cultures where his father, Akatosh, is either less related to time or where his time aspects are difficult to comprehend by the layman. He is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. It is said that Arkay did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God. <BR>
<BR>
Auri-El (King of the Aldmer): The Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of Anui-El, who, in turn, is the soul of Anu the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most Altmeri and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.<BR>
<BR>
Azura (Goddess of Dusk and Dawn): Azura was the god-ancestor that taught the Chimer the mysteries needed to be different than the Altmer. Some of her more conventional teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often more a communal cosmic force for the race as a whole than an ancestor or a god. Also known as the Anticipation of Sotha Sil. In Elsweyr, Azurah is nearly a wholly separate entity, yet she is still tied into the origins of Khajiiti out of Altmeri stock.<BR>
<BR>
Baan Dar (The Bandit God): In most regions, Baan Dar is a marginal diety, a trickster spirit of thieves and beggars. In Elsweyr he is more important, and is regarded as the Pariah. In this aspect, Baan Dar becomes the cleverness or desperate genius of the long-suffering Khajiit, whose last minute plans always upset the machinations of their (Elven or Human) enemies.  <BR>
<BR>
Boethiah (Prince of Plots): Heralded by the Prophet Veloth, Boethiah is the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his illuminations, the eventual 'Chimer', or Changed Folk, renounced all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric principles. All manner of Dark Elven cultural 'advances' are attributed to Boethiah, from philosophy to magic to 'responsible' architecture. Ancient Velothi allegories are uniformly heroic successes of Boethiah over enemies of every type, foundation stories of Chimeri struggle. Also known as the Anticipation of Almalexia. <BR>
<BR>
Diagna (Orichalc God of the Sideways Blade): Hoary thuggish cult of the Redguards. Originated in Yokuda during the Twenty Seven Snake Folk Slaughter. Diagna was an avatar of the HoonDing (the Yokudan God of Make Way, see below) that achieved permanence. He was instrumental to the defeat of the Lefthanded Elves, as he brought orichalc weapons to the Yokudan people to win the fight. In Tamriel, he led a very tight knit group of followers against the Orcs of Orsinium during the height of their ancient power, but then faded into obscurity. He is now little more than a local power spirit of the Dragontail mountains.<BR>
<BR>
Dibella (Goddess of Beauty): Popular god of the Nine Divines. In Cyrodiil, she has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction. <BR>
<BR>
Herma-Mora (The Woodland Man): Ancient Atmoran demon who, at one time, nearly seduced the Nords into becoming Aldmer. Most Ysgramor myths are about escaping the wiles of old Herma-Mora. Also called the Demon of Knowledge, he is vaguely related to the cult origins of the Morag Tong ('Foresters Guild'), if only by association with his brother/sister, Mephala. <BR>
<BR>
HoonDing (The Make Way God): Yokudan spirit of 'perseverance over infidels'. The HoonDing has historically materialized whenever the Redguards need to 'make way' for their people. In Tamrielic history this has only happened three times -- twice in the first era during the Ra Gada invasion and once during the Tiber War. In this last incarnation, the HoonDing was said to have been either a sword or a crown, or both.<BR>
<BR>
Jhunal (Rune God): The Nordic god of hermetic orders. After falling out of favor with the rest of that pantheon, he became Julianos of the Nine Divines. He is absent in modern Skyrim mythology. <BR>
<BR>
Jode (Big Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Big Moon. Also called Masser or Mara's Tear. In Khajiiti religion, Jode is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.<BR>
<BR>
Jone (Little Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Little Moon. Also called Secunda or Stendarr's Sorrow. In Khajiiti religion, Jone is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.<BR>
<BR>
Julianos (God of Wisdom and Logic): Often associated with Jhunal, the Nordic father of language and mathematics, Julianos is the Cyrodilic god of literature, law, history, and contradiction. Monastic orders founded by Tiber Septim and dedicated to Julianos are the keepers of the Elder Scrolls. <BR>
<BR>
Kyne (Kiss At the End): Nordic Goddess of the Storm. Widow of Shor and favored god of warriors. She is often called the Mother of Men. Her daughters taught the first Nords the use of the thu'um, or Storm Voice.<BR>
<BR>
Kynareth (Goddess of Air): Kynareth is a member of the Nine Divines, the strongest of the Sky spirits. In some legends, she is the first to agree to Lorkhan's plan to invent the mortal plane, and provides the space for its creation in the void. She is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhan's divine spark.<BR>
<BR>
Leki (Saint of the Spirit Sword): Goddess daughter of Tall Papa, Leki is the goddess of aberrant swordsmanship. The Na-Totambu of Yokuda warred to a standstill during the mythic era to decide who would lead the charge against the Lefthanded Elves. Their swordmasters, though, were so skilled in the Best Known Cuts as to be matched evenly. Leki introduced the Ephemeral Feint. Afterwards, a victor emerged and the war with the Aldmer began.<BR>
<BR>
Lorkhan (The Missing God): This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri 'Lorkhan', or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo -- much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the 'scheme of things' is interpreted a variety of ways. In Morrowind, for example, he is a being related to the Psijiic Endeavor, a process by which mortals are charged with transcending the gods that created them. To the High Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind.<BR>
<BR>
Lorkhaj (Moon Beast): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity, easily identified with the Missing God, Lorkhan. <BR>
<BR>
Magnus (Magus): The god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What is left of him on the world is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff. Cyrodilic legends say he can inhabit the bodies of powerful magicians and lend them his power. Associated with Zurin Arctus, the Underking.<BR>
<BR>
Malacath (God of Curses): Malacath is the reanimated dung that was Trinimac. A somewhat weak but vengeful Daedra, the Dark Elves say he is also Malak, the god-king of the orcs. He always tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.<BR>
<BR>
Malooc (Horde King): An enemy god of the Ra Gada. Led the goblins against the Redguards during the first era. Fled east when the army of the HoonDing overtook his goblin hordes.<BR>
<BR>
Mauloch (Malacath): An Orcish god, Mauloch troubled the heirs of King Harald for a long time. Fled east after his defeat at the Battle of Dragon Wall, ca. 1E660. His rage was said to fill the sky with his sulphurous hatred, later called the "Year of Winter in Summer".<BR>
<BR>
Mara (Goddess of Love): Nearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. In Skyrim, Mara is a handmaiden of Kyne. In the Empire, she is Mother-Goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the 'Anuad', the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. Depending on the religion, she is either married to Akatosh or Lorkhan, or the concubine of both.<BR>
<BR>
Mehrunes Dagon (God of Destruction): Popular Daedric power. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. In some cultures, though, Dagon is merely a god of bloodshed and betrayal. He is an especially important deity in Morrowind, where he represents its near-inhospitable terrain. <BR>
<BR>
Mephala (Androgyne):  Mephala is the Webspinner, or the Spider God. In Morrowind, he/she was the ancestor that taught the Chimer the skills they would need to evade their enemies or to kill them with secret murder. Enemies were numerous in those days since the Chimer were a small faction. He/she, along with Boethiah, organized the clan systems that eventually became the basis for the Great Houses. He/she founded the Morag Tong. Also called the Anticipation of Vivec. <BR>
<BR>
Molag Bal (God of Schemes, King of Rape): Daedric power of much importance in Morrowind. There, he is always the archenemy of Boethiah, the Prince of Plots. He is the main source of the obstacles to the Dunmer (and preceding Chimer) people. In the legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of Houses or otherwise ruin Dunmeri 'purity'. A race of supermonsters, said to live in Molag Amur, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.<BR>
<BR>
Morihaus (First Breath of Man): Ancient cultural hero god of the Cyro-Nordics. Legend portrays him as the Taker of the Citadel, an act of mythic times that established Human control over the Valley Heartland. He is often associated with the Nordic powers of thu'um, and therefore with Kynareth.<BR>
<BR>
Morwha (Teat God): Yokudan fertility goddess. Fundamental deity in the Yokudan pantheon, and the favorite of Tall Papa's wives. Still worshipped in various areas of Hammerfell, including Stros M'kai. Morwha is always portrayed as four-armed, so that she can 'grab more husbands'.<BR>
<BR>
Nerevar (Godkiller): The Chimeri king of Resdayn, the Golden Age of old Veloth. Slain during the Battle of Red Mountain, Nerevar was the Herald of the Triune Way, and is the foremost of the saints of Dunmeri faith. He is said to have killed Dumac, the Last Dwarven King, and feasted on his heart.<BR>
<BR>
Onsi (Boneshaver): Notable warrior god of the Yokudan Ra Gada, Onsi taught Mankind how to pull their knives into swords.<BR>
<BR>
Orkey (Old Knocker): A loan-god of the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during Aldmeri rule of Atmora. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that 'bound them to the count of winters'. At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Shor showed up, though, and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.<BR>
<BR>
Phynaster: Hero-god of the Summerset Isles, who taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride.<BR>
<BR>
Rajhin (Footpad): Thief god of the Khajiiti, who grew up in the Black Kiergo section of Senchal. The most famous burglar in Elsweyr's history, Rajhin is said to have stolen a tattoo from the neck of Empress Kintyra as she slept.<BR>
<BR>
Reman (The Cyrodiil): Culture god-hero of the Second Empire, Reman was the greatest hero of the Akaviri Trouble. Indeed, he convinced the invaders to help him build his own empire, and conquered all of Tamriel except for Morrowind. He instituted the rites of becoming Emperor, which included the ritual geas to the Amulet of Kings, a soulgem of immense power. His Dynasty was ended by the Dunmeri Morag Tong at the end of the first era. Also called the Worldly God.<BR>
<BR>
Riddle'Thar (Two-Moons Dance): The cosmic order deity of the Khajiiti, the Riddle'Thar was revealed to Elsweyr by the prophet Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, the Mane. The Riddle'Thar is more a set of guidelines by which to live than a single entity, but some of his avatars like to appear as humble messengers of the gods. Also known as the Sugar God.<BR>
<BR>
Ruptga (Tall Papa): Chief deity of the Yokudan pantheon. Ruptga, more commonly 'Tall Papa', was the first god to figure out how to survive the Hunger of Satakal. Following his lead, the other gods learned the 'Walkabout', or a process by which they can persist beyond one lifetime. Tall Papa set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, too. When there were too many spirits to keep track of, though, Ruptga created a helper out the dead skin of past worlds. This helper is Sep (see below), who later creates the world of mortals.<BR>
<BR>
Satakal (The Worldskin): Yokudan god of everything. A fusion of the concepts of Anu and Padomay. Basically, Satakal is much like the Nordic Alduin, who destroys one world to begin the next. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately become the Yokudan pantheon. Popular god of the Alik'r nomads.<BR>
<BR>
Sheogorath (The Mad God): The fearful obeisance of Sheogorath is widespread, and is found in most Tamrielic quarters. Contemporary sources indicate that his roots are in Aldmeri creation stories; therein, he is 'born' when Lorkhan's divine spark is removed. One crucial myth calls him the 'Sithis-shaped hole' of the world. <BR>
<BR>
Sheor (Bad Man): In Bretony, the Bad Man is the source of all strife. He seems to have started as the god of crop failure, but most modern theologians agree that he is a demonized version of the Nordic Shor, born during the dark years after the fall of Saarthal.<BR>
<BR>
Sep (The Snake): Yokudan version of Lorkhan. Sep is born when Tall Papa creates someone to help him regulate the spirit trade. Sep, though, is driven crazy by the hunger of Satakal, and he convinces some of the gods to help him make an easier alternative to the Walkabout. This, of course, is the world as we know it, and the spirits who followed Sep become trapped here, to live out their lives as mortals. Sep is punished by Tall Papa for his transgressions, but his hunger lives on as a void in the stars, a 'non-space' that tries to upset mortal entry into the Far Shores.<BR>
<BR>
Shezarr (God of Man): Cyrodilic version of Lorkhan, whose importance suffers when Akatosh comes to the fore of Imperial (really, Alessian) religion. Shezarr was the spirit behind all human undertaking, especially against Aldmeri aggression. He is sometimes associated with the founding of the first Cyrodilic battlemages. In the present age of racial tolerance, Shezarr is all but forgotten.<BR>
<BR>
Shor (God of the Underworld): Nordic version of Lorkhan, who takes sides with Men after the creation of the world. Foreign gods (i.e., Elven ones) conspire against him and bring about his defeat, dooming him to the underworld. Atmoran myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior king who leads the Nords to victory over their Aldmeri oppressors time and again. Before his doom, Shor was the chief of the gods. Sometimes also called Children's God (see Orkey, above).<BR>
<BR>
Sotha Sil (Mystery of Morrowind): God of the Dunmer, Sotha Sil is the least known of the divine Tribunal. He is said to be reshaping the world from his hidden, clockwork city.<BR>
<BR>
Stendarr (God of Mercy): God of the Nine Divines, Stendarr has evolved from his Nordic origins into a deity of compassion or, sometimes, righteous rule. He is said to have accompanied Tiber Septim in his later years. In early Altmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.<BR>
<BR>
Stuhn (God of Ransom): Nordic precursor to Stendarr, brother of Tsun. Shield-thane of Shor, Stuhn was a warrior god that fought against the Aldmeri pantheon. He showed Men how to take, and the benefits of taking, prisoners of war.<BR>
<BR>
Syrabane (Warlock's God): An Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided Bendu Olo in the Fall of the Sload. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the Thrassian Plague. He is also called the Apprentices' God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the Mages Guild.<BR>
<BR>
Tava (Bird God): Yokudan spirit of the air. Tava is most famous for leading the Yokudans to the isle of Herne after the destruction of their homeland. She has since become assimilated into the mythology of Kynareth. She is still very popular in Hammerfell among sailors, and her shrines can be found in most port cities.<BR>
<BR>
Tiber Septim (Talos, the Dragonborn): Heir to the Seat of Sundered Kings, Tiber Septim is the most important hero-god of Mankind. He conquered all of Tamriel and ushered in the Third Era (and the Third Empire). Also called Ysmir, 'Dragon of the North'.<BR>
<BR>
Trinimac: Strong god of the early Aldmer, in some places more popular than Auri-El. He was a warrior spirit of the original Elven tribes that led armies against the Men. Boethiah is said to have assumed his shape (in some stories, he even eats Trinimac) so that he could convince a throng of Aldmer to listen to him, which led to their eventual Chimeri conversion. He vanishes from the mythic stage after this, to return as the dread Malacath (Altmeri propaganda portrays this as the dangers of Dunmeri influence).<BR>
<BR>
Tsun: Extinct Nordic god of trials against adversity. Died defending Shor from foreign gods.<BR>
<BR>
Tu'whacca (Tricky God): Yokudan god of souls. Tu'whacca, before the creation of the world, was the god of Nobody Really Cares. When Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout, Tu'whacca found a purpose; he became the caretaker of the Far Shores, and continues to help Redguards find their way into the afterlife. His cult is sometimes associated with Arkay in the more cosmopolitan regions of Hammerfell.<BR>
<BR>
Vivec (Master of Morrowind): Warrior-poet god of the Dunmer. Vivec is the invisible keeper of the holy land, ever vigilant against the dark gods of the Volcano. He/she has saved the Dunmeri people from certain death on numerous occasions, most notably when he/she taught them how to breathe water for a day so that he/she could flood Morrowind and kill the Akaviri invaders, ca. 2E572.<BR>
<BR>
Xarxes: Xarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to Auri-El, and has kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments, large and small, since the beginning of time. He created his wife, Oghma, from his favorite moments in history.<BR>
Y'ffre (God of the Forest): Most important deity of the Bosmeri pantheon. While Auri-El Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere Y'ffre as the spirit of 'the now'. According to the Wood Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the Ehlnofey, or 'Earth Bones'. After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it. Y'ffre is sometimes called the Storyteller, for the lessons he taught the first Bosmer. Some Bosmer still possess the knowledge of the chaos times, which they can use to great effect (the Wild Hunt). <BR>
<BR>
Ysmir (Dragon of the North): The Nordic aspect of Talos. He withstood the power of the Greybeards' voices long enough to hear their prophecy. Later, many Nords could not look on him without seeing a dragon.<BR>
<BR>
Z'en (God of Toil): Bosmeri god of payment in kind. Studies indicate origins in both Argonian and Akaviri mythologies, perhaps introduced into Valenwood by Kothringi sailors. Ostensibly an agriculture deity, Z'en sometimes proves to be an entity of a much higher cosmic order. His worship died out shortly after the Knhaten Flu.<BR>
<BR>
Zeht (God of Farms): Yokudan god of agriculture. Renounced his father after the world was created, which is why Tall Papa makes it so hard to grow food.<BR>
<BR>
Zenithar (God of Work and Commerce, Trader God): Member of the Nine Divines, Zenithar is understandably associated with Z'en. In the Empire, however, he is a far more cultivated god of merchants and middle nobility. His worshippers say, despite his mysterious origins, Zenithar is the god 'that will always win'.<BR>

Galerion The Mystic<BR>
By Asgrim Kolsgreg<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
During the early bloody years of the Second Era, Vanus Galerion was born under the name Trechtus, a serf on the estate of a minor nobleman, Lord Gyrnasse of Sollicich-on-Ker. Trechtus' father and mother were common laborers, but his father had secretly, against the law of Lord Gyrnasse, taught himself and then Trechtus to read. Lord Gyrnasse had been advised that literate serfs were an abomination of nature and dangerous to themselves and their lords, and had closed all bookstalls within Sollicich-on-Ker. All booksellers, poets, and teachers were forbidden, except within Gyrnasse's keep. Nevertheless, a small scale smuggling operation kept a number of books and scrolls in circulation right under Gyrnasse's shadow.<BR>
<BR>
When Trechtus was eight, the smugglers were found and imprisoned. Some said that Trechtus's mother, an ignorant and religious woman fearful of her husband, was the betrayer of the smugglers, but there were other rumors as well. The trial of the smugglers was nonexistant, and the punishment swift. The body of Trechtus' father was kept hanging for weeks during the hottest summer Sollicich-on-Ker had seen in centuries.<BR>
<BR>
Three months later, Trechtus ran away from Lord Gyrnasse's estate. He made it as far as Alinor, half-way across Summerset Isle. A band of troubadours found him nearly dead, curled up in a ditch by the side of the road. They nursed him to health and employed him as an errand boy in return for food and shelter. One of the troubadours, a soothsayer named Heliand, began testing Trechtus' mind and found the boy, though shy, to be preternaturally intelligent and sophisticated given his circumstances. Heliand recognized in the boy a commonality, for Heliand had been trained on the Isle of Artaeum as a mystic.<BR>
<BR>
When the troupe was performing in the village of Potansa on the far eastern end of Summurset, Heliand took Trechtus, then a boy of eleven, to the Isle of Artaeum. The Magister of the Isle, Iachesis, recognized potential in Trechtus and took him on as pupil, giving him the name of Vanus Galarion. Vanus trained his mind on the Isle of Artaeum, as well as his body.<BR>
<BR>
Thus was the first Archmagister of the Mages Guild trained. From the Psijics of the Isle of Artaeum, he received his training. From his childhood of want and injustice, he received his philosophy of sharing knowledge.<BR>

Mixed Unit Tactics in the Five Years War<BR>
Volume One<BR>
By Codus Callonus<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
The Legions could learn from the unconventional tactics used by the Khajiit in the Five Years War against Valenwood. I was stationed at the Sphinxmoth Legion Fort on the border near Dune and witnessed many of the northern skirmishes firsthand.<BR>
<BR>
The war started with the so-called "Slaughter of Torval." The Khajiit claim that the Bosmer invaded the city without provocation and killed over a thousand citizens before being driven off by reinforcements from a nearby jungle tribe. The Bosmer claim that the attack was in retaliation for Khajiti bandits who were attacking wood caravans headed for Valenwood.<BR>
<BR>
In the spring of 3E 396 the war moved closer to Fort Sphinxmoth. I was posted on lookout and saw parts of the conflict. I later spoke with both Khajiit and Bosmer who fought in the battle, and it will serve as an excellent example of how the Khajiit used a mixture of ground and tree units to win the war.<BR>
<BR>
The Khajiit began the fight in an unusual way by sending tree-cutting teams of Cathay-raht and the fearsome Senche-raht or "Battlecats" into the outskirts of Valenwood's forests. When word reached the Bosmer that trees were being felled (allegedly a crime in the strange Bosmeri religion), a unit of archers were dispatched from larger conflicts in the south. The Bosmer were thus goaded into splitting their forces into smaller groups.<BR>
<BR>
The Bosmer archers took up positions in the remaining trees whose branches were now twenty or more feet apart, allowing some light into the forest floor. The Bosmer bent the remaining trees with their magics into small fortifications from which to fire their bows.<BR>
<BR>
When the tree-cutters arrived the next morning, a half dozen Khajiit fell to the Bosmer arrows in the first volley. After that the Khajiit took large wooden shields from the backs of the Senche-raht and made a crude shelter. The Khajiit, even the enormous Senche-raht, were able to hide between this shelter and one of the larger trees. When it became apparent that the Khajiit would not leave their shelter, some Bosmer choose to descend and engage the Khajiit sword-to-claw.<BR>
<BR>
When the Bosmer were nearly upon the shelter, one of the Khajiit began playing on a native instrument of plucked metal bars. This was a signal of some kind, and a small group of the man-like Ohmes and Ohmes-raht emerged from covered holes on the forest floor. Although outnumbered, they were attacking from behind by surprise and won the ground quickly.<BR>
<BR>
The Bosmer archers in the trees would have still won the battle were they not having troubles of their own. A group of Dagi and Dagi-raht, two of the less common forms of Khajiit who live in the trees of the Tenmar forest, jumped from one tree to another under a magical cover of silence. They took up positions in the higher branches that could not hold a Bosmer's weight. When the signal came, they used their claws and either torches or spells of fire (accounts from the two survivors I spoke with vary on this point) to distract the archers while the battle on the ground took place. A few of the archers were able to flee, but most were killed.<BR>
<BR>
Apparently the Dagi and Dagi-raht have more magical ability than is widely believed if they were able to keep themselves magically silenced for so long. One of the surviving Bosmer told me that he saw a few ordinary cats among the Dagi and even claimed that these ordinary cats are known as 'Alfiq' and that they were the spellcasters, but Bosmer are almost as unreliable as the Khajiit when it comes to the truth, and I cannot believe that a housecat can cast spells.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of the day the Khajiit lost perhaps a half-dozen fighters out a force of no more than four dozen, while the Bosmer lost nearly an entire company of archers. The survivors were unable to report back before a second company of archers arrived and this strategy was repeated again, with similar results. Finally, a much larger force was sent and the Bosmer won that battle with the help of the native animals of Valenwood. That third skirmish and the Khajiti response I will discuss in the second volume of this series.<BR>

The Khajiit claim that the Bosmer invaded the city without provocation and killed over a thousand citizens before being driven off by reinforcements from a nearby jungle tribe. The Bosmer claim that the attack was in retaliation for Khajiiti bandits who were attacking wood caravans headed for Valenwood.<BR>
<BR>
In the spring of 3E 396 the war moved closer to Fort Sphinxmoth. I was posted on lookout and saw parts of the conflict. I later spoke with both Khajiit and Bosmer who fought in the battle, and it will serve as an excellent example of how the Khajiit used a mixture of ground and tree units to win the war.<BR>
<BR>
The Khajiit began the fight in an unusual way by sending tree-cutting teams of Cathay-raht and the fearsome Senche-raht or "Battlecats" into the outskirts of Valenwood's forests. When word reached the Bosmer that trees were being felled (allegedly a crime in the strange Bosmeri religion), a unit of archers were dispatched from larger conflicts in the south. The Bosmer were thus goaded into splitting their forces into smaller groups.<BR>
<BR>
The Bosmer archers took up positions in the remaining trees whose branches were now twenty or more feet apart, allowing some light into the forest floor. The Bosmer bent the remaining trees with their magics into small fortifications from which to fire their bows.<BR>
<BR>
When the tree-cutters arrived the next morning, a half dozen Khajiit fell to the Bosmer arrows in the first volley. After that the Khajiit took large wooden shields from the backs of the Senche-raht and made a crude shelter. The Khajiit, even the enormous Senche-raht, were able to hide between this shelter and one of the larger trees. When it became apparent that the Khajiit would not leave their shelter, some Bosmer choose to descend and engage the Khajiit sword-to-claw.<BR>
<BR>
When the Bosmer were nearly upon the shelter, one of the Khajiit began playing on a native instrument of plucked metal bars. This was a signal of some kind, and a small group of the man-like Ohmes and Ohmes-raht emerged from covered holes on the forest floor. Although outnumbered, they were attacking from behind by surprise and won the ground quickly.<BR>
<BR>
The Bosmer archers in the trees would have still won the battle were they not having troubles of their own. A group of Dagi and Dagi-raht, two of the less common forms of Khajiit who live in the trees of the Tenmar forest, jumped from one tree to another under a magical cover of silence. They took up positions in the higher branches that could not hold a Bosmer's weight. When the signal came, they used their claws and either torches or spells of fire (accounts from the two survivors I spoke with vary on this point) to distract the archers while the battle on the ground took place. A few of the archers were able to flee, but most were killed.<BR>
<BR>
Apparently the Dagi and Dagi-raht have more magical ability than is widely believed if they were able to keep themselves magically silenced for so long. One of the surviving Bosmer told me that he saw a few ordinary cats among the Dagi and even claimed that these ordinary cats are known as 'Alfiq' and that they were the spellcasters, but Bosmer are almost as unreliable as the Khajiit when it comes to the truth, and I cannot believe that a housecat can cast spells.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of the day the Khajiit lost perhaps a half-dozen fighters out a force of no more than four dozen, while the Bosmer lost nearly an entire company of archers. The survivors were unable to report back before a second company of archers arrived and this strategy was repeated again, with similar results. Finally, a much larger force was sent and the Bosmer won that battle with the help of the native animals of Valenwood. That third skirmish and the Khajiiti response I will discuss in the second volume of this series.<BR>

The Underking, Ysmir Kingmaker<BR>
<BR>
With his god destroyed, Wulfharth finds it hard to keep his form. He staggers out of Red Mountain to the battlefield beyond. The world has shaken and all of Morrowind is made of fire. A strong gale picks up, and blows his ashes back to Skyrim.<BR>
<BR>
Wulfharth adopts and is adopted by the Nords then. Ysmir the Grey Wind, the Storm of Kyne. But through Lorkhan he lost his national identity. All he wants the Nords for is to kill the Tribunal. He raises a storm, sends in his people, and is driven back by Tribunal forces. The Dunmer are too strong now. Wulfharth goes underground to wait and strengthen and reform his body anew. Oddly enough, it is Almalexia who disturbs his rest, summoning the Underking to fight alongside the Tribunal against Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal, the Akaviri demon. Wulfharth disappears after Ada'Soom is defeated, and does not return for three hundred years.<BR>
<BR>
It is the rumbling of the Greybeards that wake him. Though the Empire has crumbled, there are rumors that a chosen one will come to restore it. This new Emperor will defeat the Elves and rule a united Tamriel. Naturally, Wulfharth thinks he is the figure of prophecy. He goes directly to High Hrothgar to hear the Greybeards speak. When they do, Ysmir is blasted to ash again. He is not the chosen one. It is a warrior youth from High Rock. As the Grey Wind goes to find this boy, he hears the Greybeards' warning: remember the color of betrayal, King Wulfharth.<BR>
<BR>
The Western Reach was at war. Cuhlecain, the King of Falkreath in West Cyrodiil, was in a bad situation. To make any bid at unifying the Colovian Estates, he needed to secure his northern border, where the Nords and Reachmen had been fighting for centuries. He allies with Skyrim at the Battle of Old Hrol'dan. Leading his forces was Hjalti Early-Beard. Hjalti was from the island kingdom of Alcaire, in High Rock, and would become Tiber Septim, the First Emperor of Tamriel.<BR>
<BR>
Hjalti was a shrewd tactician, and his small band of Colovian troops and Nord berserkers broke the Reachman line, forcing them back beyond the gates of Old Hrol'dan. A siege seemed impossible, as Hjalti could expect no reinforcements from Falkreath. That night a storm came and visited Hjalti's camp. It spoke with him in his tent. At dawn, Hjalti went up to the gates, and the storm followed just above his head. Arrows could not penetrate the winds around him. He shouted down the walls of Old Hrol'dan, and his men poured in. After their victory, the Nords called Hjalti Talos, or Stormcrown.<BR>
 <BR>
Cuhlecain, with his new invincible general, unifies West Cyrodiil in under a year. No one can stand before Hjalti's storms. The Underking knows that if Hjalti is to become Emperor of Tamriel, he must first capture the Eastern Heartland. Hjalti uses them both. He needs Cuhlecain in the Colovian Estates, where foreigners are mistrusted. It is obvious why he needs Ysmir. They march on the East, the battlemages surrender before their armies, and they take the Citadel. Before Cuhlecain can be crowned, Hjalti secretly murders him and his loyalist contingent. These assassinations are blamed on the enemies of Cuhlecain, which, for political reasons, are still the Western Reach. Zurin Arctus, the Grand Battlemage (not the Underking), then crowns Hjalti as Tiber Septim, new Emperor of All Cyrodiil. After he captures the Imperil Throne, Septim finds the initial administration of a fully united Cyrodiil a time-consuming task. He sends the Underking to deal with Imperial expansion into Skyrim and High Rock. Ysmir, mindful that it might seem as if Tiber Septim is in two places at once, works behind the scenes. This period of levelheaded statesmanship and diplomacy, this sudden silence, heretofore unknown in the roaring tales of Talosian conquest, are explained away later. (The assassination story is embroidered -- now it is popularly Talos' own throat that was cut.)<BR>
<BR>
The human kingdoms are conquered, even Hammerfell, whose capture was figured to be an arduous task. The Underking wants a complete invasion, a chance to battle their foreign wind spirits himself, but Tiber Septim refutes him. He has already made a better plan, one that will seem to legitimize his rule. Cyrodiil supports the losing side of a civil war and are invited in. Finally, the Empire can turn its eyes onto the Elves.<BR>
<BR>
The Underking continues to press on Tiber Septim the need to conquer Morrowind. The Emperor is not sure that it is a wise idea. He has heard of the Tribunal's power. The Underking wants his vengeance, and reminds Tiber Septim that he is fated to conquer the Elves, even the Tribunal. Arctus advises against the move but Septim covets the Ebony in Morrowind, as he sorely needs a source of capital to rebuild Cyrodiil after 400 years of war. The Underking tells him that, with the Tribunal dead, Septim might steal the Tribunal's power and use it against the High Elves (certainly the oldest enemies of Lorkhan, predating even the Tribunal). Summerset Isle is the farthest thing from Tiber Septim's mind. Even then, he was planning to send Zurin Arctus to the King of Alinor to make peace. The Ebony need wins out in the end. The Empire invades Morrowind, and the Tribunal give up. When certain conditions of the Armistice include not only a policy of noninterference with the Tribunal, but also, in the Underking's eyes, a validation of their religious beliefs, Ysmir is furious. He abandons the Empire completely. This was the betrayal the Greybeards spoke of. Or so he thinks.<BR>
<BR>
Without the Underking's power, all ideas of conquering Tamriel vanish. Would've been nice, Septim thinks, but let's just worry about Cyrodiil and the human nations. Already there is a rebellion in Hammerfell. <BR>
<BR>
Pieces of Numidium trickle in, though. Tiber Septim, always fascinated by the Dwarves, has Zurin Arctus research this grand artifact. In doing so, Arctus stumbles upon some of the stories of the war at Red Mountain. He discovers the reason the Numidium was made and some of it's potential. Most importantly, he learns the Underking's place in the War. But Zurin Arctus was working from incomplete plans. He thinks it is the heart of Lorkhan's body that is needed to power the Numidium.<BR>
<BR>
While Zurin Arctus is raving about his discovery, the prophecy finally becomes clear to Tiber Septim. This Numidium is what he needs to conquer the world. It is his destiny to have it. He contacts the Underking and says he was right all along. They should kill the Tribunal, and they need to get together and make a plan. While the Underking was away he realized the true danger of Dagoth-Ur. Something must to be done. But he needs an army, and his old one is available again. The trap is set.<BR>
<BR>
The Underking arrives and is ambushed by Imperial guards. As he takes them on, Zurin Arctus uses a soulgem on him. With his last breath, the Underking's Heart roars a hole through the Battlemage's chest. In the end, everyone is dead, the Underking has reverted back to ash, and Tiber Septim strolls in to take the soulgem. When the Elder Council arrives, he tells them about the second attempt on his life, this time by his trusted battle mage, Zurin Arctus, who was attempting a coup. He has the dead guards celebrated as heroes, even the one who was blasted to ash... He warns Cyrodiil about the dangers within, but says he has a solution to the dangers without. The Mantella.<BR>
 <BR>
The Numidium, while not the god Tiber Septim and the Dwemer hoped for (the Underking was not exactly Lorkhan, after all), it does the job. After its work on Summerset Isle a new threat appears -- a rotting undead wizard who controls the skies. He blows the Numidium apart. But it pounds him into the ground with its last flailings, leaving only a black splotch. The Mantella falls into the sea, seemingly forever.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, Tiber Septim crowns himself the First Emperor of Tamriel. He lives until he is 108, the richest man in history. All aspects of his early reign are rewritten. Still, there are conflicting reports of what really happened, and this is why there is such confusion over such questions as: Why does Alcaire claim to be the birthplace of Talos, while other sources say he came from Atmora? Why does Tiber Septim seem to be a different person after his first roaring conquests? Why does Tiber Septim betray his battlemage? Is the Mantella the heart of the battlemage or is it the heart of Tiber Septim?<BR>
 <BR>
Tiber Septim is succeeded by his grandson, Pelagius I. Pelagius is just not of the same caliber. In truth, he's a little nervous with all these provinces. Then an advisor shows up. <BR>
<BR>

Sorry I missed you. I had to run some old documents over to the Inquisitor at the Ministry of Truth, and I'm likely to be tied up there for a while. Why don't you meet me there as soon as you can? Then we can leave together as soon as I'm done. And Amaya, don't forget to bring me the two Divine Intervention scrolls you borrowed. Or, if you used them, buy a couple of new ones for me. I think I'm going to need them soon. Janand Maulinie at the Mages Guild in the Foreign Quarter keeps them in stock.<BR>

Nerevar at Red Mountain<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
[The following is from the Apographa, the hidden writings of the Tribunal Temple. It is a scholarly retelling of a tradition transmitted through the Ashlanders concerning the battle at Red Mountain and subsequent events. The Ashlanders associate this tale with the telling of Alandro Sul, a shield-companion of Nerevar who came to live among the Ashlanders after the death of Nerevar and during the ascension of the Tribunal. There are many variant treatments of this story, but the primary elements are consistent throughout the tradition. The murder of Nerevar, the tragic fate of Dagoth Ur, and the profane source of the Tribunal's divine power are denied by Temple doctrine as ignorant Ashlander superstition, and not widely known among civilized Dunmer.] <BR>
<BR>
Resdayn, present day Morrowind, was contested ground between two very different types of mer: the Chimer, who worshipped Daedra, and the Dwemer, who worshipped a profane and secret power. These two people warred with each other constantly until their lands were invaded by a young, vibrant, and violent alien culture, the Nords. <BR>
<BR>
Two heroes, one from the Chimer and one from the Dwemer, Indoril Nerevar and Dumac Dwarf-Orc, made peace between their people and together ousted the alien invaders. Then these two heroes worked long and hard to maintain that peace thereafter, though their counselors thought it could not last or, worse, that it shouldn't. Nerevar's queen and his generals-- Almalexia, Sotha Sil, Vivec-- told him to claim all Resdayn for his own. But Nerevar would not listen, for he remembered his friendship with Dumac. There would be only peace. <BR>
<BR>
Until Dagoth-Ur arrived. House Dagoth had discovered the source of the profane and secret power of the Dwemer: the legendary Heart of Lorkhan, which Dumac's people had used to make themselves immortal and beyond the measure of the gods. In fact, one of the their high priests, Kagrenac, was building a New God so that the Dwemer could claim Resdayn for their own. <BR>
<BR>
The Tribunal urged Nerevar again to make war on the Dwarves. Nerevar was troubled. He went to Dumac, his friend of old, and asked if what Dagoth-Ur said was true. But Kagrenac and the high priests of the Dwemer had kept their New God secret from their King, and Dumac said the Dwemer were innocent of any wrongdoing. Nerevar was troubled again and made pilgrimage to Holamayan, the sacred temple of Azura, who confirmed that all that Dagoth-Ur said was indeed true and that the New God of the Dwemer should be destroyed for the safety of not only Resdayn, but for the whole world. When Nerevar went back and told his Tribunal what the goddess had said, his queen and generals felt themselves proved aright and again counseled him to war. There were reasons that the Dwemer and Chimer had hated each other forever. <BR>
<BR>
Finally, Nerevar, angered that his friend Dumac would lie to him, went back to Vvardenfell. This time the Chimer King was arrayed in arms and armor and had his hosts around him, and he spoke harshly to Dumac Dwarf-Orc, King of Red Mountain. "You must give up your worship of the Heart of Lorkhan or I shall forget our friendship and the deeds that were accomplished in its name!" And Dumac, who still knew nothing of Kagrenac's New God, but proud and protective as ever of his people, said, "We shall not relinquish that which has been our way for years beyond reckoning, just as the Chimer will not relinquish their ties to the Lords and Ladies of Oblivion. And to come at my door in this way, arrayed in arms and armor and with your hosts around you, tells me you have already forgotten our friendship. Stand down, my sweet Nerevar, or I swear by the fifteen-and-one golden tones I shall kill you and all your people." <BR>
<BR>
And so the Chimer and Dwemer went to war. The Dwemer were well-defended by their fortress at Red Mountain, but the bravery and cleverness of Nerevar's queen and generals drew most of Dumac's armies out into the field and kept them there, so that Nerevar and Dagoth-Ur could make their way into the Heart Chamber by secret means. There, Nerevar met Dumac and the Dwarf King and they both fell from grievous wounds. Dagoth-Ur slew Kagrenac and took the tools the Dwemer used to tap the power of the Heart. He went to his dying lord Nerevar and asked him what to do with these tools. And Nerevar summoned Azura again, and she showed them how to use the tools to separate the power of the Heart from the Dwemer people. <BR>
<BR>
And on the fields, the Tribunal and their armies watched as the Dwemer turned into dust all around them as their stolen immortality was taken away. <BR>
<BR>
Back in Red Mountain, Nerevar told Dagoth-Ur to protect the tools and the Heart Chamber until he returned. Dagoth-Ur said, "But shouldn't we destroy these tools at once, so that they might never be used for evil again?" But Nerevar was confused by his wounds and his sorrow (for he still loved Dumac and the Dwemer people) and so went to the fields outside of Red Mountain to confer with his queen and his generals, who had foreseen that this war would come and whose counsel he would not ignore again. "I will ask the Tribunal what we shall do with them, for they have had wisdom in the past that I had not. Stay here, loyal Dagoth-Ur, until I return." <BR>
<BR>
Then Nerevar told his queen and generals all that had transpired under Red Mountain and how the Dwemer had used special tools to turn their people into immortals and of the wondrous power of the Heart of Lorkhan. The Tribunal decided that the Chimer should learn how to use this power so that Nerevar might claim Resdayn and the world for their people. Nerevar did not expect or want this, so he asked his queen and generals to help him summon Azura yet again for her guidance. But the Tribunal had become as greedy as Kagrenac upon hearing of the power of the Heart and they coveted it. They made ritual as if to summon Azura as Nerevar wanted but Almalexia used poisoned candles and Sotha Sil used poisoned robes and Vivec used poisoned invocations. Nerevar was murdered. <BR>
<BR>
Then Azura came forth anyway and cursed the Tribunal for their foul deeds. She told them that she would use her powers over dusk and dawn to make sure Nerevar would come back and make things right again. But the Tribunal laughed at her and said that soon they would be gods themselves and that the Chimer people would forget their old ways of worship. And Azura knew this would be true and that it would take a long time before her power might bring Nerevar back. "What you have done here today is foul beyond measure and you will grow to regret it, for the lives of gods are not what mortals think and matters that weigh only years to mortals weigh on gods forever." And so that they might know forever their wicked deeds Azura changed the Chimer into Dunmer, and their skin turned ashen and their eyes into fire. "Let this mark remind you of your true selves who, like ghouls, fed on the nobility, heroism, and trust of their king." <BR>
<BR>
And then the Tribunal went into Red Mountain and met with Dagoth-Ur. Dagoth-Ur saw what had been done, for his skin had changed as well, and he tried to avenge the death of Nerevar but to no avail. He was driven off and thought dead. The Tribunal found the tools he had been guarding and, through study of Kagrenac's methods, turned themselves into gods. <BR>
<BR>
Thousands of years after their apotheosis, the Tribunal are still the gods of Morrowind and the old ways of worship are remembered only by a few. And the murder of Nerevar is known to fewer. But his queen and generals still fear his return, for the words of Azura linger long and they see the mark of her curse on their people every day. <BR>

I have the honor to acquaint you with his Majesty's wishes concerning %PCName, an individual of no rank or consequence.<BR>
<BR>
%PCName has been released from prison by his Majesty's authority and sent to you with this missive. %PCName is to be entered as a Novice in the Imperial Order of the Blades, and is to serve under your absolute authority as you shall see fit, except insofar as his Majesty's particular wishes are concerned.<BR>
<BR>
His Majesty's particular wishes are as follows.<BR>
<BR>
A local superstition holds that an orphan and outcast, a youth born on a certain day to uncertain parents, shall unite all the tribes of the Dunmer, drive out the invaders of Morrowind, and shall reestablish the ancient laws and customs of the Dark Elven nations. This orphan and outcast is called in legend the "Nerevarine," and is supposed to be a reincarnation of the long-dead Dunmer General and First Councilor, Lord Indoril Nerevar.<BR>
<BR>
%PCName has the appearance of meeting the conditions of this local superstition. Therefore it is his Majesty's desire that %PCName shall, insofar as is possible, satisfy the conditions of this ancient prophecy, and shall become the Nerevarine.<BR>
<BR>
Though this prophecy is indeed only an ancient local superstition, his Majesty has taken counsel on this matter with his most expert informants and confidants, and his Majesty is persuaded that the prophecy is genuine and significant, either in its entirety, or in its several parts, and he earnestly demands you treat this matter with the utmost seriousness.<BR>
<BR>
Certain aspects of this ancient superstition are described at the end of this document, and further materials will be forthcoming by courier at the earliest occasion. It will, of course, be necessary that you acquaint yourself better with the details of this ancient superstition from your local sources. Since this matter intimately concerns %PCName, it is expected that you will employ him to gather information on this subject. His Majesty has taken a great personal interest in the legends and prophecies of the Nerevarine, and eagerly awaits reports your reports.<BR>

Mushrooms of the Bitter Coast<BR>
Journeyman Report from Ajira<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
Ajira studies four common mushrooms in Vvardenfell.<BR>
<BR>
Luminous Russula is a toadstool like mushroom with a brown spot on top. All Russula has strong odors, but Luminous Russula much stronger. Russula can be poison if not prepared right. When mixed with pearl dust it makes very good potion to breathe under the water.<BR>
<BR>
Violet Coprinus is a tall toadstool that glows in the night. Coprinus also is poison if mixed wrongly like if you mix with Russula. Coprinus mixed with scales lets Ajira walk on the water instead of under the water. Much better.<BR>
<BR>
Bungler's Bane looks like a brown shelf and grows from trees and sometimes wet rocks. Bungler's Bane very bad for you when mixed with almost anything. Very hard to use, but Ajira found Bungler's Bane and left over crushed pearl makes good dispel potion. No bad effects with Ajira's skill, but potion tastes very bad.<BR>
<BR>
Hypha Facia looks just like Bungler's Bane. Confuses Ajira very easily, but Bungler's Bane smells more dry and dusty. Hypha Facia has little smell, but taste is very moist. Hypha Facia very good mushroom for eating, but too much makes Ajira clumsy. Ajira used Hypha Facia to make the nix hound meat more edible, and Ajira could smell all enchantments in Ajira's room. Ajira found no other use for Hypha Facia.<BR>
<BR>
Ajira works very hard to go all over Bitter Coast and collect all these mushrooms. Ajira deserves rank of Journeyman much sooner than Galbedir.<BR>

Luminous Russula is a toadstool like mushroom with a brown spot on top. All Russula has strong odors, but Luminous Russula much stronger. Russula can be poison if not prepared right. When mixed with pearl dust it makes very good potion to breathe under the water.<BR>
<BR>
Violet Coprinus is a tall toadstool that glows in the night. Coprinus also is poison if mixed wrongly like if you mix with Russula. Coprinus mixed with scales lets Ajira walk on the water instead of under the water. Much better.<BR>
<BR>
Bungler's Bane looks like a brown shelf and grows from trees and sometimes wet rocks. Bungler's Bane very bad for you when mixed with almost anything. Very hard to use, but Ajira found Bungler's Bane and left over crushed pearl makes good dispel potion. No bad effects with Ajira's skill, but potion tastes very bad.<BR>
<BR>
Hypha Facia looks just like Bungler's Bane. Confuses Ajira very easily, but Bungler's Bane smells more dry and dusty. Hypha Facia has little smell, but taste is very moist. Hypha Facia very good mushroom for eating, but too much makes Ajira clumsy. Ajira used Hypha Facia to make the nix-hound meat more edible, and Ajira could smell all enchantments in Ajira's room. Ajira found no other use for Hypha Facia.<BR>
<BR>
Ajira works very hard to go all over Bitter Coast and collect all these mushrooms. Ajira deserves rank of Journeyman much sooner than Galbedir.<BR>

Tamrielic Artifacts<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
The following are notes I have gathered, over the past centuries, of items of unimaginable significance. All have been seen, owned, and lost, again and again throughout Tamriel. Some may be myth, others may be hoax, but regardless, many have lost their lives attempting to find or protect these very coveted items. <BR>
<BR>
Lord's Mail<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes called the Armor of Morihaus or the gift of Kynareth, this is an ancient cuirass of unsurpassable quality. It grants the wearer power to absorb health, resist the effects of spells, and cure oneself of poison when used. It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the wearer unworthy, the Lord's Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next chosen one.<BR>
<BR>
Ebony Mail<BR>
<BR>
The Ebony Mail is a breastplate created before recorded history by the Dark Elven goddess Boethiah. It is she who determines who should possess the Ebony Mail and for how long a time. If judged worthy, its power grants the wearer added resistance of fire, magicka, and grants a magical shield. It is Boethiah alone who determines when a person is ineligible to bear the Ebony Mail any longer, and the goddess can be very capricious.<BR>
<BR>
Spell Breaker<BR>
<BR>
Spell Breaker, superficially a Dwemer tower shield, is one of the most ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historical importance in the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder almost completely from any spell caster, either by reflecting magicks or silencing any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that Spell Breaker still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property of anyone else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any length of time is power enough.<BR>
<BR>
Chrysamere<BR>
<BR>
The Paladin's Blade is an ancient claymore with offensive capabilities surpassed only by its own defenses. It lends the wielder health, protects him or her from fire, and reflects any spells cast against the wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere been wielded by any bladesman for any length of time, for it chooses not to favor one champion.<BR>
<BR>
Staff of Magnus<BR>
<BR>
The Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a metaphysical battery of sorts for its creator, Magnus. When used, it absorbs an enemy's health and mystical energy. In time, the Staff will abandon the mage who wields it before he becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical balance it is sworn to protect.<BR>
<BR>
Warlock's Ring<BR>
<BR>
The Warlock's Ring of the Archmage Syrabane is one of the most popular relics of myth and fable. In Tamriel's ancient history, Syrabane saved all of the continent by judicious use of his Ring, and ever since, it has helped adventurers with less lofty goals. It is best known for its ability to reflect spells cast at its wearer and to improve his or her speed and to restore health. No adventurer can wear the Warlock's Ring for long, for it is said that the Ring is Syrabane's alone to command.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of Phynaster<BR>
<BR>
The Ring of Phynaster was made hundreds of years ago by a man who needed good defenses to survive his adventurous life. Thanks to the Ring, Phynaster lived for hundreds of years, and since then it has passed from person to person. The Ring improves its wearer's overall resistance to poison, magicka, and shock. Still, Phynaster was cunning and cursed the ring so that it eventually disappears from its holder's possessions and returns to another resting place, discontent to stay anywhere but with Phynaster himself.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of Khajiit<BR>
<BR>
The Ring of the Khajiit is an ancient relic, hundreds of years older than Rajhin, the thief that made the Ring famous. It was Rajhin who used the Ring's powers to make himself invisible and as quick as the breath of wind. Using the Ring, he became the most successful burglar in Elsweyr's history. Rajhin's eventual fate is a mystery, but according to legend, the Ring rebelled against such constant use and disappeared, leaving Rajhin helpless before his enemies.<BR>
<BR>
Mace of Molag Bal<BR>
<BR>
Also known as the Vampire's Mace, the Mace of Molag Bal drains its victims of magicka and gives it to the bearer. It also has the ability to transfer an enemy's strength to its wielder. Molag Bal has been quite free with his artifact. There are many legends about the Mace. It seems to be a favorite for vanquishing wizards. <BR>
<BR>
Masque of Clavicus Vile<BR>
<BR>
Ever the vain one, Clavicus Vile made a masque suited to his own personality. The bearer of the Masque is more likely to get a positive response from the people of Tamriel. The higher his personality, the larger the bonus. The best known story of the Masque tells the tale of Avalea, a noblewoman of some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the Masque in return. Though the Masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a well connected baron, Clavicus Vile reclaimed the Masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was banished from the Baron's household. Twenty one years and one day later, Avalea's daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the Baron.<BR>
<BR>
Mehrunes Razor<BR>
<BR>
The Dark Brotherhood has coveted this ebony dagger for generations. This mythical artifact is capable of slaying any creature instantly. History does not record any bearers of Mehrune's Razor. However, the Dark Brotherhood was once decimated by a vicious internal power struggle. It is suspected that the Razor was involved.<BR>
<BR>
Cuirass of the Savior's Hide<BR>
<BR>
Another of Hircine's artifacts was the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide. The Cuirass has the special ability to resist magicka. Legend has it that Hircine rewarded his peeled hide to the first and only mortal to have ever escaped his hunting grounds. This unknown mortal had the hide tailored into this magical Cuirass for his future adventures. The Savior's Hide has a tendency to travel from hero to hero as though it has a mind of its own.<BR>
<BR>
Spear of Bitter Mercy<BR>
<BR>
One of the more mysterious artifacts is the Spear of Bitter Mercy. Little to nothing is known about the Spear. There are no recorded histories but many believe it to be of Daedric origin. The only known legend about it is its use by a mighty hero during the fall of the Battlespire. The hero was aided by the Spear in the defeat of Mehrunes Dagon and the recapturing of the Battlespire. Since that time, the Spear of Bitter Mercy has made few appearances within Tamriel.<BR>
<BR>
Daedric Scourge<BR>
<BR>
The Daedric Scourge is a mighty mace forged from sacred ebony in the Fires of Fickledire. The legendary weapon of Mackkan, it was once a fierce weapon used to send spirits of black back into Oblivion. The weapon lhas the ability to summon creatures from Oblivion, Once a tool used against the Daedric Lords in the Battlespire, it now roams the land with adventurers. <BR>
<BR>
Bow of Shadows<BR>
<BR>
Legend has it that the Bow of Shadows was forged by the Daedra Nocturnal. The legendary ranger, Raerlas Ghile, was granted the Bow for a secret mission that failed, and the Bow was lost. Raerlas did not go down without a hearty fight and is said to have, with the aid of the Bow, taken scores of his foes with him. The Bow grants the user the ability of invisibility and increased speed. Many sightings of the Bow of Shadows have been reported, and it is even said that the sinister Dark Elf assassin of the Second Era, Dram, once wielded this bow.<BR>
<BR>
Fists of Randagulf<BR>
<BR>
Randagulf of Clan Begalin goes down in Tamrielic history as one of the mightiest warriors from Skyrim. He was known for his courage and ferocity in battle and was a factor in many battles. He finally met his fate when King Harald conquered Skyrim. King Harald respected this great hero and took Randagulf's gauntlets for his own. After King Harald died, the gauntlets disappeared. The King claimed that the Fists granted the bearer added strength.<BR>
<BR>
Ice Blade of the Monarch<BR>
<BR>
The Ice Blade of the Monarch is truly one of Tamriel's most prized artifacts. Legend has it that the Evil Archmage Almion Celmo enchanted the claymore of a great warrior with the soul of a Frost Monarch, a stronger form of the more common Frost Atronach. The warrior, Thurgnarr Assi, was to play a part in the assassination of a great king in a far off land, and become the new leader. The assassination failed and the Archmage was imprisoned. The Ice Blade freezes all who feel its blade. The Blade circulates from owner to owner, never settling in one place for long.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of Surroundings<BR>
<BR>
Little is known of this prize but it is said that it lends the wearer the ability to blend in with their surroundings.<BR>
<BR>
Boots of the Apostle<BR>
<BR>
The Boots of the Apostle are a true mystery. The wearer of the boots is rumored to be able to levitate, though nobody has ever seen them used.<BR>
<BR>
The Mentor's Ring<BR>
<BR>
This ring is a prized possession for any apprentice to magic. It lends the wearer the ability to increase their intelligence and wisdom, thus making their use of magic more efficient. The High Wizard Carni Asron is said to be the creator of the Ring. It was a construct for his young apprentices while studying under his guidance. After Asron's death, the Ring and several other possessions vanished and have been circulated throughout Tamriel.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of the Wind<BR>
<BR>
No facts are known about this Ring, but the title and the few rumors lend one to think it grants the wearer added speed.<BR>
<BR>
Vampiric Ring<BR>
<BR>
One of the more deadly and rare artifacts in Tamriel is the Vampiric Ring. It is said that the Ring has the power to steal its victim's health and grant it to the wearer. The exact nature and origin of the Ring is wholly unknown, but many elders speak of its evil creation in Morrowind long, long ago by a cult of Vampire followers. The Vampiric Ring is an extremely rare artifact and is only seen every few hundred cycles of the moons.<BR>
<BR>
Eleidon's Ward<BR>
<BR>
Eleidon was a holy knight of legend in Breton history. He was a sought after man for his courage and determination to set all wrongs right. In one story, it is said that he rescued a Baron's daughter from sure death at the hands of an evil warlord. For his reward, the Baron spent all of his riches to have an enchanted shield built for Eidelon. The Shield granted Eleidon the opportunity to heal his wounds.<BR>
<BR>
Staff of Hasedoki<BR>
<BR>
Hasedoki was said to have been a very competitive wizard. He wandered the land in search for a wizard who was greater than he. To the best of all knowledge, he never found a wizard who could meet up to his challenge. It is said that he felt so lonely and isolated because so many feared his power, that he bonded his life-force into his very own staff, where his soul remains to this very day. Magic users all over Tamriel have been searching for this magical staff. Granting its wielder a protection of magicka, it is a sure prize for any magic user.<BR>
<BR>
Bloodworm Helm<BR>
<BR>
The King of Worms was said to have left behind one of his prized possessions, the Bloodworm Helm. The Helm is a construct of magically formed bone. The Helm allows the user to summon skeletons and control the undead. It would be a prized artifact to a necromancer.<BR>
<BR>
Dragonbone Mail<BR>
<BR>
This cuirass is one of the greatest artifacts any collector or hero could own. It is constructed of real dragon bone and was enchanted by the first Imperial Battlemage, Zurin Arctus, in the early years of the Third Era. It is a truly exquisite piece of work and many have sought to possess it. The properties of the Cuirass allow the wearer to be resist fire, and to damage an enemy with a blast of fire. Little is known about the involvement of Zurin Arctus with the enchantment of the Cuirass, but an old tale speaks of a debt that he owed to a traveling warrior. Like the warrior, the Dragonbone Mail never stays put for long.<BR>
<BR>
Skull Crusher<BR>
<BR>
The Skull Crusher is an amazingly large, and powerful weapon. The Warhammer was created in a fire, magically fueled by the Wizard, Dorach Gusal, and was forged by the great weaponsmith, Hilbongard Rolamus. The steel is magically hardened and the weight of the weapon is amazingly light, which makes for more powerful swings and deadly blows. The Warhammer was to be put on display for a festival, but thieves got it first. The Skull Crusher still travels Tamriel in search of its creators.<BR>
<BR>
Goldbrand<BR>
<BR>
This magical Sword is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient dragons of the North. Their tales claim that it was given to a great knight who was sworn to protect the dragons. The Sword lends its wielder the ability to do fire damage on an enemy. Goldbrand has not been sighted in recent history and is said to be awaiting a worthy hero.<BR>
<BR>
Fang of Haynekhtnamet<BR>
<BR>
Black Marsh was once known to be inhabited with what the Argonians called the Wamasus. Northern men considered them to be intelligent dragons with lightning for blood. One such mighty beast, Haynekhtnamet, was slain by the Northern men, though it took 7 days and nights, and a score of men. One of the surviving men took a fang home as a trophy. The fang was carved down into a blade and fashioned into a small dagger. The Dagger mysteriously houses some of the beast's magical properties and grants the user the ability to do shock damage on an opponent. This unique Dagger is seen occasionally by traveling heroes.<BR>
<BR>
Umbra Sword<BR>
<BR>
The Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch Naenra Waerr, and its sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very choosy when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a worthy one is found.<BR>
<BR>
Denstagmer's Ring<BR>
<BR>
All that is known of this Ring is that it may grant the user protection from certain elements. Even the name Denstagmer is a mystery.<BR>
<BR>
Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw<BR>
<BR>
One of Valenwood's legendary heroes is Oreyn Bearclaw. Son of King Faume Toad-Eye, he was a respected clan hunter and a future leader. Wood Elven legend claims Oreyn single handedly defeated Glenhwyfaunva, the witch-serpent of the Elven wood, forever bringing peace to his clan. Oreyn would go on to accomplish numerous other deeds, eventually losing his life to the Knahaten Flu. His Helm stood as a monument of his stature for future generations to remember. The Helm was lost eventually, as the Clan split, and is now a treasured artifact for adventurers. The Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw is rumored to improve the wearers agility and endurance.<BR>
Daedric Crescent Blade<BR>
<BR>
Probably the most rare and even outlawed item of all the great prizes is the Daedric Crescent Blade. The Blade was used by Mehrunes Dagon's Daedric forces in the capture of the Imperial Battlespire. These extremely unique Blades were gathered up and destroyed after the Battlespire was recaptured by the Empire. All but one it seems. Though the Empire believes them all to be destroyed, it is rumored that one still remains in existence, somewhere in Tamriel, though none have ever seen it. The Blade lends it's weilder the ability to do great damage on an enemy and allows him to paralyze and put heavy wear on his enemy's armor. Quite the prize for any mighty warrior, if it does indeed exist.<BR>

Sometimes called the Armor of Morihaus or the gift of Kynareth, this is an ancient cuirass of unsurpassable quality. It grants the wearer power to absorb health, resist the effects of spells, and cure oneself of poison when used. It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the wearer unworthy, the Lord's Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next chosen one.<BR>
<BR>
Ebony Mail<BR>
<BR>
The Ebony Mail is a breastplate created before recorded history by the Dark Elven goddess Boethiah. It is she who determines who should possess the Ebony Mail and for how long a time. If judged worthy, its power grants the wearer added resistance of fire, magicka, and grants a magical shield. It is Boethiah alone who determines when a person is ineligible to bear the Ebony Mail any longer, and the goddess can be very capricious.<BR>
<BR>
Spell Breaker<BR>
<BR>
Spell Breaker, superficially a Dwemer tower shield, is one of the most ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historical importance in the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder almost completely from any spell caster, either by reflecting magicks or silencing any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that Spell Breaker still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property of anyone else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any length of time is power enough.<BR>
<BR>
Chrysamere<BR>
<BR>
The Paladin's Blade is an ancient claymore with offensive capabilities surpassed only by its own defenses. It lends the wielder health, protects him or her from fire, and reflects any spells cast against the wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere been wielded by any bladesman for any length of time, for it chooses not to favor one champion.<BR>
<BR>
Staff of Magnus<BR>
<BR>
The Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a metaphysical battery of sorts for its creator, Magnus. When used, it absorbs an enemy's health and mystical energy. In time, the Staff will abandon the mage who wields it before he becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical balance it is sworn to protect.<BR>
<BR>
Warlock's Ring<BR>
<BR>
The Warlock's Ring of the Archmage Syrabane is one of the most popular relics of myth and fable. In Tamriel's ancient history, Syrabane saved all of the continent by judicious use of his Ring, and ever since, it has helped adventurers with less lofty goals. It is best known for its ability to reflect spells cast at its wearer and to improve his or her speed and to restore health. No adventurer can wear the Warlock's Ring for long, for it is said that the Ring is Syrabane's alone to command.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of Phynaster<BR>
<BR>
The Ring of Phynaster was made hundreds of years ago by a man who needed good defenses to survive his adventurous life. Thanks to the Ring, Phynaster lived for hundreds of years, and since then it has passed from person to person. The Ring improves its wearer's overall resistance to poison, magicka, and shock. Still, Phynaster was cunning and cursed the ring so that it eventually disappears from its holder's possessions and returns to another resting place, discontent to stay anywhere but with Phynaster himself.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of Khajiit<BR>
<BR>
The Ring of the Khajiit is an ancient relic, hundreds of years older than Rajhin, the thief that made the Ring famous. It was Rajhin who used the Ring's powers to make himself invisible and as quick as the breath of wind. Using the Ring, he became the most successful burglar in Elsweyr's history. Rajhin's eventual fate is a mystery, but according to legend, the Ring rebelled against such constant use and disappeared, leaving Rajhin helpless before his enemies.<BR>
<BR>
Mace of Molag Bal<BR>
<BR>
Also known as the Vampire's Mace, the Mace of Molag Bal drains its victims of magicka and gives it to the bearer. It also has the ability to transfer an enemy's strength to its wielder. Molag Bal has been quite free with his artifact. There are many legends about the Mace. It seems to be a favorite for vanquishing wizards. <BR>
<BR>
Masque of Clavicus Vile<BR>
<BR>
Ever the vain one, Clavicus Vile made a masque suited to his own personality. The bearer of the Masque is more likely to get a positive response from the people of Tamriel. The higher his personality, the larger the bonus. The best known story of the Masque tells the tale of Avalea, a noblewoman of some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the Masque in return. Though the Masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a well connected baron, Clavicus Vile reclaimed the Masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was banished from the Baron's household. Twenty one years and one day later, Avalea's daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the Baron.<BR>
<BR>
Mehrunes Razor<BR>
<BR>
The Dark Brotherhood has coveted this ebony dagger for generations. This mythical artifact is capable of slaying any creature instantly. History does not record any bearers of Mehrune's Razor. However, the Dark Brotherhood was once decimated by a vicious internal power struggle. It is suspected that the Razor was involved.<BR>
<BR>
Cuirass of the Savior's Hide<BR>
<BR>
Another of Hircine's artifacts was the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide. The Cuirass has the special ability to resist magicka. Legend has it that Hircine rewarded his peeled hide to the first and only mortal to have ever escaped his hunting grounds. This unknown mortal had the hide tailored into this magical Cuirass for his future adventures. The Savior's Hide has a tendency to travel from hero to hero as though it has a mind of its own.<BR>
<BR>
Spear of Bitter Mercy<BR>
<BR>
One of the more mysterious artifacts is the Spear of Bitter Mercy. Little to nothing is known about the Spear. There are no recorded histories but many believe it to be of Daedric origin. The only known legend about it is its use by a mighty hero during the fall of the Battlespire. The hero was aided by the Spear in the defeat of Mehrunes Dagon and the recapturing of the Battlespire. Since that time, the Spear of Bitter Mercy has made few appearances within Tamriel.<BR>
<BR>
Daedric Scourge<BR>
<BR>
The Daedric Scourge is a mighty mace forged from sacred ebony in the Fires of Fickledire. The legendary weapon of Mackkan, it was once a fierce weapon used to send spirits of black back into Oblivion. The weapon has the ability to summon creatures from Oblivion, Once a tool used against the Daedric Lords in the Battlespire, it now roams the land with adventurers. <BR>
<BR>
Bow of Shadows<BR>
<BR>
Legend has it that the Bow of Shadows was forged by the Daedra Nocturnal. The legendary ranger, Raerlas Ghile, was granted the Bow for a secret mission that failed, and the Bow was lost. Raerlas did not go down without a hearty fight and is said to have, with the aid of the Bow, taken scores of his foes with him. The Bow grants the user the ability of invisibility and increased speed. Many sightings of the Bow of Shadows have been reported, and it is even said that the sinister Dark Elf assassin of the Second Era, Dram, once wielded this bow.<BR>
<BR>
Fists of Randagulf<BR>
<BR>
Randagulf of Clan Begalin goes down in Tamrielic history as one of the mightiest warriors from Skyrim. He was known for his courage and ferocity in battle and was a factor in many battles. He finally met his fate when King Harald conquered Skyrim. King Harald respected this great hero and took Randagulf's gauntlets for his own. After King Harald died, the gauntlets disappeared. The King claimed that the Fists granted the bearer added strength.<BR>
<BR>
Ice Blade of the Monarch<BR>
<BR>
The Ice Blade of the Monarch is truly one of Tamriel's most prized artifacts. Legend has it that the Evil Archmage Almion Celmo enchanted the claymore of a great warrior with the soul of a Frost Monarch, a stronger form of the more common Frost Atronach. The warrior, Thurgnarr Assi, was to play a part in the assassination of a great king in a far off land, and become the new leader. The assassination failed and the Archmage was imprisoned. The Ice Blade freezes all who feel its blade. The Blade circulates from owner to owner, never settling in one place for long.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of Surroundings<BR>
<BR>
Little is known of this prize but it is said that it lends the wearer the ability to blend in with their surroundings.<BR>
<BR>
Boots of the Apostle<BR>
<BR>
The Boots of the Apostle are a true mystery. The wearer of the boots is rumored to be able to levitate, though nobody has ever seen them used.<BR>
<BR>
The Mentor's Ring<BR>
<BR>
This ring is a prized possession for any apprentice to magic. It lends the wearer the ability to increase their intelligence and wisdom, thus making their use of magic more efficient. The High Wizard Carni Asron is said to be the creator of the Ring. It was a construct for his young apprentices while studying under his guidance. After Asron's death, the Ring and several other possessions vanished and have been circulated throughout Tamriel.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of the Wind<BR>
<BR>
No facts are known about this Ring, but the title and the few rumors lend one to think it grants the wearer added speed.<BR>
<BR>
Vampiric Ring<BR>
<BR>
One of the more deadly and rare artifacts in Tamriel is the Vampiric Ring. It is said that the Ring has the power to steal its victim's health and grant it to the wearer. The exact nature and origin of the Ring is wholly unknown, but many elders speak of its evil creation in Morrowind long, long ago by a cult of Vampire followers. The Vampiric Ring is an extremely rare artifact and is only seen every few hundred cycles of the moons.<BR>
<BR>
Eleidon's Ward<BR>
<BR>
Eleidon was a holy knight of legend in Breton history. He was a sought after man for his courage and determination to set all wrongs right. In one story, it is said that he rescued a Baron's daughter from sure death at the hands of an evil warlord. For his reward, the Baron spent all of his riches to have an enchanted shield built for Eidelon. The Shield granted Eleidon the opportunity to heal his wounds.<BR>
<BR>
Staff of Hasedoki<BR>
<BR>
Hasedoki was said to have been a very competitive wizard. He wandered the land in search for a wizard who was greater than he. To the best of all knowledge, he never found a wizard who could meet up to his challenge. It is said that he felt so lonely and isolated because so many feared his power, that he bonded his life-force into his very own staff, where his soul remains to this very day. Magic users all over Tamriel have been searching for this magical staff. Granting its wielder a protection of magicka, it is a sure prize for any magic user.<BR>
<BR>
Bloodworm Helm<BR>
<BR>
The King of Worms was said to have left behind one of his prized possessions, the Bloodworm Helm. The Helm is a construct of magically formed bone. The Helm allows the user to summon skeletons and control the undead. It would be a prized artifact to a necromancer.<BR>
<BR>
Dragonbone Mail<BR>
<BR>
This cuirass is one of the greatest artifacts any collector or hero could own. It is constructed of real dragon bone and was enchanted by the first Imperial Battlemage, Zurin Arctus, in the early years of the Third Era. It is a truly exquisite piece of work and many have sought to possess it. The properties of the Cuirass allow the wearer to be resist fire, and to damage an enemy with a blast of fire. Little is known about the involvement of Zurin Arctus with the enchantment of the Cuirass, but an old tale speaks of a debt that he owed to a traveling warrior. Like the warrior, the Dragonbone Mail never stays put for long.<BR>
<BR>
Skull Crusher<BR>
<BR>
The Skull Crusher is an amazingly large, and powerful weapon. The Warhammer was created in a fire, magically fueled by the Wizard, Dorach Gusal, and was forged by the great weaponsmith, Hilbongard Rolamus. The steel is magically hardened and the weight of the weapon is amazingly light, which makes for more powerful swings and deadly blows. The Warhammer was to be put on display for a festival, but thieves got it first. The Skull Crusher still travels Tamriel in search of its creators.<BR>
<BR>
Goldbrand<BR>
<BR>
This magical Sword is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient dragons of the North. Their tales claim that it was given to a great knight who was sworn to protect the dragons. The Sword lends its wielder the ability to do fire damage on an enemy. Goldbrand has not been sighted in recent history and is said to be awaiting a worthy hero.<BR>
<BR>
Fang of Haynekhtnamet<BR>
<BR>
Black Marsh was once known to be inhabited with what the Argonians called the Wamasus. Northern men considered them to be intelligent dragons with lightning for blood. One such mighty beast, Haynekhtnamet, was slain by the Northern men, though it took 7 days and nights, and a score of men. One of the surviving men took a fang home as a trophy. The fang was carved down into a blade and fashioned into a small dagger. The Dagger mysteriously houses some of the beast's magical properties and grants the user the ability to do shock damage on an opponent. This unique Dagger is seen occasionally by traveling heroes.<BR>
<BR>
Umbra Sword<BR>
<BR>
The Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch Naenra Waerr, and its sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very choosy when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a worthy one is found.<BR>
<BR>
Denstagmer's Ring<BR>
<BR>
All that is known of this Ring is that it may grant the user protection from certain elements. Even the name Denstagmer is a mystery.<BR>
<BR>
Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw<BR>
<BR>
One of Valenwood's legendary heroes is Oreyn Bearclaw. Son of King Faume Toad-Eye, he was a respected clan hunter and a future leader. Wood Elven legend claims Oreyn single handedly defeated Glenhwyfaunva, the witch-serpent of the Elven wood, forever bringing peace to his clan. Oreyn would go on to accomplish numerous other deeds, eventually losing his life to the Knahaten Flu. His Helm stood as a monument of his stature for future generations to remember. The Helm was lost eventually, as the Clan split, and is now a treasured artifact for adventurers. The Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw is rumored to improve the wearers agility and endurance.<BR>
<BR>
Daedric Crescent Blade<BR>
<BR>
Probably the most rare and even outlawed item of all the great prizes is the Daedric Crescent Blade. The Blade was used by Mehrunes Dagon's Daedric forces in the capture of the Imperial Battlespire. These extremely unique Blades were gathered up and destroyed after the Battlespire was recaptured by the Empire. All but one it seems. Though the Empire believes them all to be destroyed, it is rumored that one still remains in existence, somewhere in Tamriel, though none have ever seen it. The Blade lends its wielder the ability to do great damage on an enemy and allows him to paralyze and put heavy wear on his enemy's armor. Quite the prize for any mighty warrior, if it does indeed exist.<BR>

A few tones of Dwemer believed that using the power Lorkhan's Heart was an unjustifiable risk. "The Egg of Time" contains Bthuand's arguments against this idea, many of which are quite compelling.

I have slept beneath it once or twice. The Valley of the Wind is a valley on the northeast slopes of Red Mountain. The entrance to the valley is marked by Airan's Teeth, two tall rock spires.

We know nothing for sure, but we have learned much from interrogating Sixth House cultists and victims of dream compulsions, and from our study of Dagoth Ur's actions. The Temple scholars and Inquisitors have prepared a document, 'Dagoth Ur's Plans,' that summarizes what we know or suspect. Take this copy. It's also available in my library.

If you will deliver Rasha's shirts...these fine, fine shirts...to Bivale Teneran the clothier in Ald-ruhn, she will pay you for your services. And a generous woman she is.

I've heard something about a secret cult worshipping Dagoth Ur. The idea is that the Tribunal are false gods who have betrayed Morrowind to the Imperials. The cult plans to overthrow the Temple and drive the Empire from Morrowind. The cult is outlawed by the Temple, the Great Houses, or the Empire, and I doubt it's very popular. I've also heard there's some connection with smuggling... that they smuggle goods, or hire smugglers, or something like that.

Only one trooper returned. He died soon after, horribly disfigured with corprus disease, and out of his wits. In his ravings, he spoke of a cavern on the coast -- he called it "Ilunibi." It's not on our maps; try asking locals in Gnaar Mok. They fought with cultists and disfigured man-beasts -- corprus monsters, I think. They fled the attackers and got lost in the caves. Then they ran into a half-man creature named Dagoth Gares.

I don't know whether vampirism is a disease. And if it is a disease, I don't know if it can be cured, or how. But I have heard rumors of a cure for vampirism. And I recall reading a reference in a rare local book that might be useful. Look for a book called 'Vampires of Vvardenfell, Volume II.' It might be hard to find here. It was suppressed by the Temple. But I recall reading something there about a Buoyant Armiger who became a vampire, but who was cured.

Great Houses culture is partly defined by its roots in ancient Dunmer tribal clans, and partly by later Imperial  influences from other Western cultures. The Great Houses culture is only one of the native Dunmer cultures of Morrowind. The other native culture, the Ashlander culture, is a nomadic barbarian culture largely untouched by Imperial influences.

> INFO.NAME red mountain 4371325022824424232
The dominant feature of Vvardenfell, Red Mountain is a vast volcano in the center of Vvardenfell. The outer slopes are steep and rugged, and the crater is deep and dotted with surface lava. The Ghostfence, a magical barrier which blocks travel as well as seals in the harmful, disease-laden weather called 'blight,' rings the volcano's outer slopes, and is broken only at Ghostgate. Within the Ghostfence, rain never falls and the sun never shines; the only weather is the red and deadly ash-blight.

It is another Ashlander prophecy of the Nerevarine. It is called "The Seven Curses of the Sharmat." But I do not know it, and I know no one who does. It may be lost. Such things happen. A wise woman dies, or forgets, or a clan is wiped out. Perhaps someone knows, but is keeping it secret. Perhaps it is in one of those many books of your settled peoples. I have heard that the Dissident priests of the Temple may have such books.

Yes, I can now translate these books. This first one is Bthuand Mzahnch's refutation of a popular theory from Nerevar's time. A few tones of Dwemer believed that using the power Lorkhan's Heart was an unjustifiable risk. "The Egg of Time" contains Bthuand's arguments against this idea, many of which are quite compelling. The next book, "Divine Metaphysics," is an explanation of how the Dwemer tried to make a new god, Anumidium, using Kagrenac's tools and the sacred tones on Lorkhan's heart.

By refreshing my memory with "Divine Metaphysics," I believe I can explain. The Dwemer were not unified in their thinking. Kagrenac and his tonal architects, among them Bthuand Mzahnch, believed they could improve the Dwemer race. Others argued that the attempt would be too great a risk. The war with Nerevar and the Dunmer may have led Kagrenac to carry out his experiments prematurely. Although this book argues that nothing disastrous could result, the disappearance of my race argues otherwise.

At the same time, the Legions and magistrates guarantee rule of law and justice, and free trade has made everybody in Vvardenfell prosperous. But there's still a lot of race hatred, and slavery ought to be outlawed, regardless of 'sacred Dunmer customs.' And the proud Dunmer will always be bitter about the Occupation.

You can get cured at shrines or temples easily -- but you need to get cured, or people don't want to talk with you. Blight disease is more serious, and potions and cures are harder come by. Corprus disease can't be cured. And some say vampirism is a disease. But the only cure for a vampire is destroying it. Policy on vampires is 'kill on sight'. Or 'run on sight'.

Ha! A right funny story that one is! The true story, %PCName, is that I took Hlormar on as a traveling companion for protection only for the road to Caldera. Along the way he was getting entirely too friendly for his own good, to the point where I actually had to cast a sleep spell on him. Just to teach him a lesson in manners, I stripped him and left him by the road.  And to be sure he didn't come after me for retribution, I took that Cloudcleaver he's always fawning over as well.

She's being watched; if something has gone wrong, find her private quarters; she'll leave you a message there under the code word 'amaya.' Then take the lost prophecies to Nibani Maesa. From that point, you'll have to follow her directions, and follow the prophecies. Good luck.

The Bosmer are the clanfolk of the Western Valenwood forests. In the Empire, they are called "Wood Elves," but they call themselves the Bosmer, or the 'Tree-Sap' people. They scorn pretense and formality, preferring a romantic, simple existence in harmony with the wild beauty of nature. They are nimble and quick in body and wit, and there are no finer archers in all of Tamriel.

The Horror of Castle Xyr<BR>
A One Act Play<BR>
by Baloth-Kul<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
Dramatis Personae<BR>
Clavides, Captain of the Imperial Guard. Cyrodilic.<BR>
Anara, a Dunmer maid.<BR>
Ullis, a Lieutenant of the Imperial Guard. Argonian.<BR>
Zollassa, a young Argonian mage.<BR>
<BR>
Late evening. The play opens in the interior Great Entrance Hall of a castle in Scath Anud, replete with fine furnishings and tapestries. Torches provide the only illumination. In the center of the foyer is a great iron door, the main entrance to the castle. The staircase up to the landing above is next to this door. On stage left is the door to the library, which is currently closed. On stage right is a huge suit of armor, twenty feet tall, nearly touching the ceiling of the room. Though no one can be seen, there is the sound of a woman singing coming from the library door.<BR>
<BR>
A loud thumping knock on the iron front door stops the woman's singing. The door to the library opens and ANARA, a common-looking maid, comes out and hurries to open the front door.  CLAVIDES, a handsome man in Imperial garb, stands there.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: Good evening to you, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Good evening. Is your master at home?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: No, serjo, it's only me here. My master, Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr, is at his winter estate. Is there something I can do for you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Possibly. Would you mind if I came in?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: Not at all, serjo. Please. May I offer you some flin?<BR>
<BR>
Clavides comes into the Hall and looks around.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  No, thank you. What's your name?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Anara, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Anara, when did your master leave Scath Anud?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  More than a fortnight ago. That's why it's only me in the castle, serjo. All the other servants and slaves who tend to his lordship travel with him. Is there something wrong?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Yes, there is. Do you know an Ashlander by the name of Sul-Kharifa?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: No, serjo. I know no one by that name.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Then you aren't likely to now. He's dead. He was found a few hours ago dying of frostbite in the ashlands. He was hysterical, nearly incomprehensible, but among his last words were $93castle$94 and $93Xyr.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Dying of frostbite in summertide in the ashlands? B'vek, that's strange. I suppose it's possible that my master knew this man, but being an ashlander and my master being of the House of Telvanni, well, if you'll pardon me for being flippant, serjo, I don't think they would be friends.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  That is your master's library? Would you mind if I looked in?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Please, serjo, go wherever you want. We have nothing to hide. We're loyal Imperial subjects.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: As, I hear, are all Telvanni.<BR>
<BR>
(Note from the playwright: this line should be delivered without sarcasm. Trust the audience to laugh -- it never fails, regardless of the politics of the locals.)<BR>
<BR>
Clavides enters the library and looks over the books.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  The library needs dusting.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Yes, serjo. I was just doing that when you knocked at the door.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I'm grateful for that. If you had finished, I wouldn't notice the space in the dust where a rather large book has recently been removed. Your master is a wizard, it seems.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  No, serjo. I mean, he studies a lot, but he don't cast no spells, if that's what you mean by wizard. He's a kena, went to college and everything. You know, now that I think about it, I know what happened to that book. One of the other kenas from the college been round yesterday, and borrowed a couple of books. He's a friend of the master, so I thought it'd be all fine.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  This kena, was his name Warvim?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Coulda been. I don't remember.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  There is a suspected necromancer at the college named Kena Warvim we arrested last night. We don't know what he was doing at the college, but it was something illegal, that's for certain. Was that the kena who borrowed the book? A little fellow, a cripple with a withered leg?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  No, serjo, it weren't the kena from yesterday. He was a big fella who could walk, so I noticed.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: I'm going to have a look around the rest of the house, if you don't mind.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides goes up the stairs, and delivers the following dialogue from the landing and the rooms above. Anara continues straightening up the downstairs, moving a high-backed bench in front of the armor to scrub the floor.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Can I ask, serjo, what you're looking for? Maybe I could help you.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Are these all the rooms in the castle? No secret passages?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA (laughing):  Oh, serjo, what would Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr want with secret passages?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (looking at the armor):  Your master is a big man.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA (laughing):  Oh, serjo, don't tease. That's giant armor, just for decoration.  My master slew that giant ten years ago, and kind of keeps it for a souvenir.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  That's right, I remember hearing something about that when I first took my post here. It was someone named Xyr who killed the giant, but I didn't think the first name was Hordalf. Memory fades, I'm afraid.  hat was the giant's name?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I'm afraid I don't remember, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I do. It was Torfang. $93I got out of Torfang's Shield.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I don't understand, serjo. Torfang's shield?<BR>
<BR>
Clavides runs down the stairs, and examines the armor.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Sul-Kharifa said something about getting out of Torfang's shield. I thought he was just raving, out of his mind.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  But he ain't got a shield, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides pushes the high-backed bench out of the way, revealing the large mounted shield at the base of the armor.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Yes, he does. You covered it up with that bench.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I didn't do it on purpose, serjo! I was just cleaning! I see that armor every day, serjo, and b'vek I swear I ain't never noticed the shield before!<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It's fine, Anara, I believe you.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides pushes on the shield and it pulls back to reveal a tunnel down.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It appears that Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr does have a need for a secret passage. Could you get me a torch?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  B'vek, I ain't never seen that before!<BR>
<BR>
Anara takes a torch from the wall, and hands it to Clavides. Clavides enters the tunnel.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Wait here.<BR>
<BR>
Anara watches Clavides disappear down the tunnel. She appears agitated, and finally runs for the front door. When she opens it, ULLIS, an Argonian lieutenant in the Imperial guard is standing at the entrance. She screams.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  I'm sorry to frighten you.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Not now! Go away!<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  I'm afraid the Captain wouldn't like that, miss.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  You're... with the Captain? Blessed mother.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides comes out of the tunnel, white-faced. It takes him a few moments to speak.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Captain? What's down there?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (to Anara):  Did you know your master's a necromancer? That your cellar is filled with bodies?<BR>
<BR>
Anara faints. Ullis carries her to the bench and lays her down.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Let me see, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  You'll see soon enough. We're going to need every soldier from the post here to cart away all the corpses. Ullis, I've seen enough battles, but I've never seen anything like this. No two are alike.  Khajiiti, sload, dunmer, cyrodiil, breton, nord, burned alive, poisoned, electrified, melted, torn apart, turned inside out, ripped to shreds and sewn back up together.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  You think the Ashlander escaped, that's what happened?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I don't know. Why would someone do something like this, Ullis?<BR>
<BR>
There is a knock on the door. Clavides answers it. A young Argonian woman, ZOLLASSA, is standing, holding a package and a letter.<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Good morning, you're not Lord Xyr, are you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  No. What do you have there?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  A letter and a package I'm supposed to deliver to him. Will he be back shortly?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I don't believe so. Who gave you the package to deliver?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  My teacher at the college, Kema Warvim. He has a bad leg, so he asked me to bring these to his lordship. Actually, to tell you the truth, I was supposed to deliver them last night, but I was busy.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Greetings, sistre. We'll give the package to his lordship when we see him.<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Ah, hail, brothre. I had heard there was a handsome Argonian in Scath Anud. Unfortunately, I promised Kema Warvim that I'd deliver the package directly to his lordship's hands. I'm already late, I can't just --<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  We're Imperial Guard, miss. We will take the package and the letter.<BR>
<BR>
Zollassa reluctantly hands Clavides the letter and the package. She turns to go.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  You're at the college, if we need to see you?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Yes. Fare tidings, brothre.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Goodnight, sistre.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides opens the package as Zollassa exits. It is a book with many loose sheets.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It appears we've found the missing book. Delivered to our very hands.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides begins to read the book, silently to himself.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (to himself, very pleased): Another Argonian in Scath Anud. And a pretty one, at that. I hope we weren't too rude to her. I'm tired of all these women with their smooth, wet skin, it would be wonderful if we could meet when I'm off duty.  <BR>
<BR>
While Ullis talks, he opens the letter and reads it.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (continued):  She looks like she's from the south, like me. You know, Argonians from northern Black Marsh are... much... less...<BR>
<BR>
Ullis continues reading, transfixed by the letter. Clavides skips to the back of the book, and reads the last sentences.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (reading): In black ink $93The Khajiiti male showed surprisingly little fortitude against a simple lightning spell, but I've had interesting physiological results with a medium-level acid spell cast slowly over several days.$94 In red ink on the margins, $93Yes, I see. Was the acid spell cast uniformly over the entire body of the subject?$94 In black ink $93The Nord female was subjected to sixteen hours of a frost spell which eventually crystalized her into a state of suspended animation, from which she eventually expired. Not so the Nord male, nor the Ashlander male who lapsed into their comas much earlier, but then recovered. The Ashlander then tried to escape, but I restrained him. The Nord then had an interesting chemical overreaction to a simple fire spell and expired. See the accompanying illustration.$94 In red ink, $93Yes, I see. The pattern of boils and lesions suggest some sort of internal incineration perhaps caused by the combination of a short burst of flame following a longer session with frost. It's such a shame I can't come to see the experiment personally, but I compliment you on your excellent notation.$94 In black ink, $93Thank you for the suggestion about slowly poisoning my maid Anara. The dosages you've suggested have had fascinating results, eroding her memory very subtly. I intend to increase it expotentially and see how long it is before she notices. Speaking of which, it is a pity that I haven't any Argonian subjects, but the slave-traders promise me some healthy specimens in the autumn. I should like to test their metabolism in comparison to elves and humans. It's my theory that a medium-level lightning spell cast in a continuous wave on an Argonian wouldn't be lethal for several hours at least, similiar to my results with the Cyrodilic female and, of course, the giant.$94 In red ink, $93It'd be a shame to wait until autumn to see.$94<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (reading the letter):  In red ink, $93Here is your Argonian. Please let me know the results.$94 It's signed $93Kema Warvim.$94<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  By Kynareth, this isn't necromancy. It's Destruction. Kema Warvim and Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr haven't been experimenting with death, but with the limits of magical torture.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  The letter isn't addressed to Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr. It's addressed to Sedura Iachilla Xyr. His wife, do you think?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Iachilla.  That was the Telvanni of the Xyr family who I heard about in connection with the giant slaying. We'd best get the maid out of here. She'll need to go to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides wakes up Anara.  She appears disoriented.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  What's happening? Who are you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Don't worry, everything is going to be fine. We're going to take you to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Do you need a coat, Iachilla?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Thank you, no, I'm not cold --<BR>
<BR>
Anara/Iachilla stops, realizing that she's been caught. Clavides and Ullis unsheathe their blades.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  You have black ink on your fingers, your ladyship.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  And when you saw me at the door, you thought I was the Argonian your friend Warvim sent over. That's why you said, $93Not now. Go away.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA/IACHILLA:  You're much more observant than Anara. She never did understand what was happening, even when I tripled the poison spell and she expired in what I observed as considerable agony.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  What were you going to use on me first, lightning or fire?<BR>
<BR>
ANANA/IACHILLA:  Lightning. I find fire to be too unpredictable.<BR>
<BR>
As she speaks, the flames in the torchs extinguish. The stage is utterly dark.<BR>
<BR>
There is the sound of a struggle, swords clanging. Suddenly a bolt of lightning flashes out, and there is silence. From the darkness, Anana/Iachilla speaks.<BR>
<BR>
ANANA/IACHILLA: Fascinating.<BR>
<BR>
There are several more flashes of lightning as the curtain closes.<BR>
<BR>
THE END.<BR>

The pattern of boils and lesions suggest some sort of internal incineration perhaps caused by the combination of a short burst of flame following a longer session with frost. It's such a shame I can't come to see the experiment personally, but I compliment you on your excellent notation.$94 In black ink, $93Thank you for the suggestion about slowly poisoning my maid Anara. The dosages you've suggested have had fascinating results, eroding her memory very subtly. I intend to increase it expotentially and see how long it is before she notices. Speaking of which, it is a pity that I haven't any Argonian subjects, but the slave-traders promise me some healthy specimens in the autumn. I should like to test their metabolism in comparison to elves and humans. It's my theory that a medium-level lightning spell cast in a continuous wave on an Argonian wouldn't be lethal for several hours at least, similiar to my results with the Cyrodilic female and, of course, the giant.$94 In red ink, $93It'd be a shame to wait until autumn to see.$94<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (reading the letter):  In red ink, $93Here is your Argonian. Please let me know the results.$94 It's signed $93Kema Warvim.$94<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  By Kynareth, this isn't necromancy. It's Destruction. Kema Warvim and Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr haven't been experimenting with death, but with the limits of magical torture.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  The letter isn't addressed to Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr. It's addressed to Sedura Iachilla Xyr. His wife, do you think?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Iachilla.  That was the Telvanni of the Xyr family who I heard about in connection with the giant slaying. We'd best get the maid out of here. She'll need to go to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides wakes up Anara.  She appears disoriented.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  What's happening? Who are you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Don't worry, everything is going to be fine. We're going to take you to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Do you need a coat, Iachilla?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Thank you, no, I'm not cold --<BR>
<BR>
Anara/Iachilla stops, realizing that she's been caught. Clavides and Ullis unsheathe their blades.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  You have black ink on your fingers, your ladyship.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  And when you saw me at the door, you thought I was the Argonian your friend Warvim sent over. That's why you said, $93Not now. Go away.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA/IACHILLA:  You're much more observant than Anara. She never did understand what was happening, even when I tripled the poison spell and she expired in what I observed as considerable agony.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  What were you going to use on me first, lightning or fire?<BR>
<BR>
ANANA/IACHILLA:  Lightning. I find fire to be too unpredictable.<BR>
<BR>
As she speaks, the flames in the torchs extinguish. The stage is utterly dark.<BR>
<BR>
There is the sound of a struggle, swords clanging. Suddenly a bolt of lightning flashes out, and there is silence. From the darkness, Anana/Iachilla speaks.<BR>
<BR>
ANANA/IACHILLA: Fascinating.<BR>
<BR>
There are several more flashes of lightning as the curtain closes.<BR>
<BR>
THE END.<BR>

Here is one of my finest pack rats.  He'll follow you around, right behind you, wherever you go. AND he'll carry small burdens for you. But take good care of him. Seems a shame to eat the poor little fellows, after all the trouble I have in capturing them and training them. But.. the customer is always right, and they're yours to do with as you wish.

That's right, you can have a scrib for the low, low price of 20 gold, or a rat for 25. They are trained to follow you and attack anyone who attacks you. OR you can buy my exclusive pack rat for 100 gold. They not only follow and fight, but also carry small burdens. And, in a pinch, you've got fresh meat on the hoof, whenever you need it. What do you say?  Would you like one?

That's what it was, all right.  The folly of youth.  Had dreams, aspirations.  I foolishly followed them, and took my wife to Vvardenfell for what was supposed to be a "great adventure".  I paid for my foolishness, paid in full.  Unfortunately, my wife was made to pay as well.  She caught the Blight shortly after arriving, and her frail constitution couldn't handle it.  I lost her to the damned disease, and it ruined me.  No one could replace her.  None of the women I've ever know could ever replace her.

I found the wreckage of a crashed airship, and read the journal of its captain.  It seems the crew had been commissioned to locate and explore Hrothmund's Barrow in search of some magic item.  Before they could set down, the airship got caught in a surprise snowstorm and crashed into the mountains.  I should get this journal to the man who sponsored the expedition -- Louis Beauchamp, at the Ald'ruhn Guild of Mages on Vvardenfell.

The crew was to fly to Solstheim and search a barrow located at the eye of a wolf-shaped formation called Hrothmund's Bane, which is only visible from the air.  In order to gain entrance to the barrow, one must utter the name of the wolf that killed Hrothmund -- "Ondjage."  If the wrong name is spoken, the crypt will be sealed forever.

I came to Solstheim with four of my brothers-in-arms. We were on a quest, you see. We were getting close...we could feel it.

A few months ago I was ferrying some settlers from Skyrim to Solstheim.  I was tired...so tired.  I fell asleep at the rudder.  The ship drifted into a gale, and by the time I woke, it was too late.  I couldn't regain control, and the ship capsized.  There were only two survivors -- me, and an old man whose entire family was lost in the wreck.  I told the man of my terrible failure, and he used his power as a seer and wizard to punish me.  You see, %PCName, I have been cursed with eternal wakefulness.

I came to Thirsk all the way from Cyrodiil, by way of Vvardenfell.  My father once visited Solstheim, you see, and as a boy I was intrigued by his exciting stories of the Nords.  I was particularly fascinated with this very mead hall -- its residents and their adventures, things like that.  I arrived here over a year ago, and have been living among the Nords ever since.  I've been chronicling their lives, and recently collected enough data to complete my history of Thirsk.

I have long believed that I, Athellor, have the blood of the Falmer flowing through my veins!  I'm on a journey of self-discovery, %PCName.  I wish to know who I am, and where I came from. I'm hoping that if I find some evidence of the Falmer's existence, I will better understand myself, and my past.  But alas, I'm a noble, not an adventurer.  That's why I've come to this establishment.   I'm hoping to hire an explorer to do some of the more...physical work. Another drink?

I have the Heart of the Udyrfrykte, %PCClass, and will place it on the pedestal of Thirsk as soon as the mead hall has been repaired.  But you have not yet received the blessing of Hrothmund the Red.  I know this, for the chill air whispers to me.  It speaks to me of sorrow and death.  If Hrothmund chooses to bless you, I will sense it in the wind.  I will know there is hope for Thirsk.

*Yawn!*  Ah, hello, my friend. You are well, I hope? I've been trying to get some sleep, but it's not easy out here in the cold. Thirsk is closed for repairs, so I've lost my bed. The Udyrfrykte did quite a lot of damage. The mead hall will stay closed, too, unless someone is strong enough to claim the chieftain's throne. I'd do it myself, but I'm too damned tired to bother.

%PCName!  I've had some time to rest, and am ready to grant your reward. As a sea captain, I discovered many hidden places, one of which is a magnificent ice dungeon called Gyldenhul. It lies on a small island off the northeast coast of Solstheim, not too far from here, actually. The dungeon is loaded with riches, and I want you to have it all. Take this key -- the door is heavily locked. Oh, and I'll mark the dungeon on your map. Now I must get back to sleep.  Thanks again!

My goodness, I feel so silly wearing this bear armor.  I know, I look quite ridiculous.  But at least it will keep me warm while I'm outside waiting for Thirsk to reopen.  I'm not a Nord, you see.  I'm a Breton.  I'm a bookseller by trade, but my real passion is writing.  The Solstheim Nords are my area of expertise, you might say. I recently finished two scholarly works -- Thirsk, a History and Sovngarde, a Reexamination.  I have copies of both for sale, among others.

%PCName!  I've had some time to rest, and am ready to grant your reward.  As a sea captain, I discovered many hidden places, one of which is an ancient barrow called Gyldenhul. It lies on a small island off the northeast coast of Solstheim, not too far from here, actually. The barrow is loaded with riches, and I want you to have it all. Take this key -- the door is heavily locked. Oh, and I'll mark the dungeon on your map. Now, I must get back to sleep.  Thanks again!

So, you've been sent by Thormoor Gray-Wave, have you?  What's the matter, is the poor shipmaster feeling a bit fatigued?  Does he wish he could get just a moment's rest?  I can't say I blame him.  Being cursed with eternal wakefulness can be rather unpleasant, or so I'd hoped.
