The Wolf Queen, Book Eight<BR>

From the pen of Inzolicus, Second Century Sage:<BR>

3E 127<BR>
Following the Battle of Ichidag, the Emperor Uriel Septim III was captured and, before he was able to be brought to his uncle's castle in the Hammerfell kingdom of Gilane, he met his death at the hands of an angry mob.  This uncle, Cephorus, was thereafter proclaimed emperor and rode to the Imperial City.  The troops formerly loyal to Emperor Uriel and his mother, the Wolf Queen Potema, pledged themselves to the new Emperor.  In return for their support, the nobility of Skyrim, High Rock, Hammerfell, the Summerset Isle, Valenwood, Black Marsh, and Morrowind demanded and received a new level of autonomy and independence from the Empire.  The War of the Red Diamond was at an end.<BR>
<BR>
Potema continued to fight a losing battle, her area of influence dwindling and dwindling until only her kingdom of Solitude remained in her power. She summoned daedra to fight for her, had her necromancers resurrect her fallen enemies as undead warriors, and mounted attack after attack on the forces of her brothers, the Emperor Cephorus Septim I and King Magnus of Lilmoth.  Her allies began leaving her as her madness grew, and her only companions were the zombies and skeletons she had amassed over the years.  The kingdom of Solitude became a land of death.  Stories of the ancient Wolf Queen being waited on by rotting skeletal chambermaids and holding war plans with vampiric generals terrified her subjects.<BR>

3E 137<BR>
Magnus opened up the small window in his room.  For the first time in weeks, he heard the sounds of a city: carts squeaking, horses clopping over the cobblestones, and somewhere a child laughing.  He smiled as he returned to his bedside to wash his face and finish dressing.  There was a distinctive knock on the door.<BR>
<BR>
$93Come in, Pel,$94 he said.<BR>
<BR>
Pelagius bounded into the room.  It was obvious that he had been up for hours.  Magnus marveled at his energy, and wondered how much longer battles would last if they were run by twelve-year-old boys.<BR>
<BR>
$93Did you see outside yet?$94 Pelagius asked. $93All the townspeople have come back!  There are shops, and a Mages Guild, and down by the harbor, I saw a hundred shops come in from all over the place!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93They don't have to be afraid anymore.  We've taken care of all the zombies and ghosts that used to be their neighbors, and they know it's safe to come back.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Is Uncle Cephorus going to turn into a zombie when he dies?$94 asked Pelagius.<BR>
<BR>
$93I wouldn't put that past him,$94 laughed Magnus. $93Why do you ask?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I heard some people saying that he was old and sick,$94 said Pelagius.<BR>
<BR>
$93He's not that old,$94 said Magnus. $93He's sixty years old.  That's just two years older than I.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93And how old is Aunt Potema?$94 asked Pelagius.<BR>
<BR>
$93Seventy,$94 said Magnus. $93And yes, that is old.  Any more questions will have to wait.  I have to go meet with the commander now, but we can talk at supper.  You can make yourself busy, and not get into any trouble?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, sir,$94 said Pelagius.  He understood that his father had to continue to hold siege on aunt Potema's castle.  After they took it over and locked her up, they would move out of the inn and into the castle.  Pelagius was not looking forward to that.  The whole town had a funny, sweet, dead smell, but he could not get even as close as the castle moat without gagging from the stench.  They could dump a million flowers on the place and it wouldn't make any difference at all.<BR>
<BR>
He walked through the city for hours, buying some food and then some ribbons for his sister and mother back in Lilmoth.  He thought about who else he needed to buy gifts for and was stumped.  All his cousins, the children of Uncle Cephorus, Uncle Antiochus, and Aunt Potema, had died during the war, some of them in battle and some of them during the famines because so many crops had been burned.  Aunt Bianki had died last year.  There was only he, his mother, his sister, his father, and his uncle the Emperor left.  And Aunt Potema.  But she didn't really count.<BR>
<BR>
When he came upon the Mages Guild earlier that morning, he had decided not to go in.  Those places always spooked him with their strange smoke and crystals and old books.  This time, it occurred to Pelagius that he might buy a gift for Uncle Cephorus.  A souvenir of Solitude's Mages Guild.<BR>
<BR>
An old woman was having trouble with the front door, so Pelagius opened it for her.<BR>
<BR>
$93Thank you,$94 she said.<BR>
<BR>
She was easily the oldest thing he had ever seen.  Her face looked like an old rotted apple framed with a wild whirl of bright white hair.  He instinctively moved away from her gnarled talon when she started to pat him on the head.  But there was a gem around her neck that immediately fascinated him.  It was a single bright yellow jewel, but it almost looked there was something trapped within.  When the light hit it from the candles, it brought out the form of a four-legged beast, pacing.<BR>
<BR>
$93It's a soul gem,$94 she said. $93Infused with the spirit of a great demon werewolf.  It was enchanted long, long ago with the power to charm people, but I've been thinking about giving it another spell.  Perhaps something from the School of Alteration like Lock or Shield.$94 She paused and looked at the boy carefully with yellowed, rheumy eyes. $93You look familiar to me, boy.  What's your name?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Pelagius,$94 he said.  He normally would have said $93Prince Pelagius,$94 but he was told not to draw attention to himself while in town.<BR>
<BR>
$93I used to know someone named Pelagius,$94 the old woman said, and slowly smiled. $93Are you here alone, Pelagius?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My father is... with the army, storming the castle.  But he'll be back when the walls have been breached.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Which I dare say won't take too much longer,$94 sighed the old woman. $93Nothing, no matter how well built, tends to last.  Are you buying something in the Mages Guild?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I wanted to buy a gift for my uncle,$94 said Pelagius. $93But I don't know if I have enough gold.$94<BR>
<BR>
The old woman left the boy to look over the wares while she went to the Guild enchanter.  He was a young Nord, ambitious, and new to the kingdom of Solitude.  It took little persuasion and a lot of gold to convince him to remove the charm spell from the soul gem and imbue it with a powerful curse, a slow poison that would drain wisdom from its wearer year by year until he or she lost all reason.  She also purchased a cheap ring of fire resistance.<BR>
<BR>
$93For your kindness to an old woman, I've bought you these,$94 she said, giving the boy the necklace and the ring. $93You can give the ring to your uncle, and tell him it has been enchanted with a levitation spell, so if ever he needs to leap from high places, it will protect him.  The soulgem is for you.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Thank you,$94 said the boy. $93But this is too kind of you.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Kindness has nothing to do with it,$94 she answered, quite honestly. $93You see, I was in the Hall of Records at the Imperial Palace once or twice, and I read about you in the foretellings of the Elder Scrolls.  You will be Emperor one day, my boy, the Emperor Pelagius Septim III, and with this soul gem to guide you, posterity will always remember you and your deeds.$94<BR>
<BR>
With those words, the old woman disappeared down an alley behind the Mages Guild.  Pelagius looked after her, but he did not think to search behind a heap of stones.  If he had, he would have found a tunnel under the city into the very heart of Castle Solitude.  And if he had found his way there, he would have found, past the shambling undead and the moldering remains of a once grand palace, the bedroom of the queen.<BR>
<BR>
In that bedroom, he would find the Wolf Queen of Solitude in repose, listening to the sounds of her castle collapsing.  And he would see a toothless grin growing on her face as she breathed her last.<BR>
<BR>
From the pen of Inzolicus, Second Century Sage:<BR>
<BR>
3E 137<BR>
Potema Septim died after a month long siege on her castle.  While she lived, she had been the Wolf Queen of Solitude, Daughter of the Emperor Pelagius II, Wife of King Mantiarco, Aunt of the Empress Kintyra II, Mother of Emperor Uriel III, and Sister of the Emperors Antiochus and Cephorus.  At her death, Magnus appointed his son, Pelagius, as the titular head of Solitude, under guidance from the royal council. <BR>
<BR>
3E 140<BR>
The Emperor Cephorus Septim died after falling from his horse.  His brother was proclaimed the Emperor Magnus Septim.<BR>
<BR>
3E 141<BR>
Pelagius, King of Solitude, is recorded as $93occasionally eccentric$94 in the Imperial Annals.  He marries Katariah, Duchess of Vvardenfell.<BR>
<BR>
3E 145<BR>
The Emperor Magnus Septim dies.  His son, who will be known as Pelagius the Mad, is coronated.<BR>

The Horror of Castle Xyr<BR>
A One Act Play<BR>
by Baloth-Kul<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
Dramatis Personae<BR>
Clavides, Captain of the Imperial Guard.  Cyrodilic.<BR>
Anara, a Dunmer maid.<BR>
Ullis, a Lieutenant of the Imperial Guard.  Argonian.<BR>
Zollassa, a young Argonian mage<BR>
<BR>
Late evening.  The play opens in the interior Great Entrance Hall of a castle in Scath Anud, replete with fine furnishings and tapestries.  Torches provide the only illumination.  In the center of the foyer is a great iron door, the main entrance to the castle.  The staircase up to the landing above is next to this door.  On stage left is the door to the library, which is currently closed.  On stage right is a huge suit of armor, twenty feet tall, nearly touching the ceiling of the room.  Though no one can be seen, there is the sound of a woman singing coming from the library door.<BR>
<BR>
A loud thumping knock on the iron front door stops the woman's singing.  The door to the library opens and ANARA, a common-looking maid, comes out and hurries to open the front door.  CLAVIDES, a handsome man in Imperial garb stands there.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: Good evening to you, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Good evening.  Is your master at home?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: No, serjo, it's only me here.   My master Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr is at his winter estate.  Is there something I can do for you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Possibly.  Would you mind if I came in?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: Not at all, serjo.  Please.  May I offer you some flin?<BR>
<BR>
Clavides comes into the Hall and looks around.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  No thank you.  What's your name?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Anara, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Anara, when did your master leave Scath Anud?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  More than a fortnight ago.  That's why it's only me in the castle, serjo.  All the other servants and slaves who tend to his lordship travel with him.  Is there something wrong?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Yes, there is.  Do you know an ashlander by the name of Sul-Kharifa?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: No, serjo.  I don't know no one by that name.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Then you aren't likely to now.  He's dead.  He was found a few hours ago dying of frostbite in the ashlands.  He was hysterical, nearly incomprehensible, but among his last words were $93castle$94 and $93Xyr.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Dying of frostbite in summertide in the ashlands?  B'vek, that's strange.  I suppose it's possible that my master knew this man, but being an ashlander and my master being of the House of Telvanni, well, if you'll pardon me for being flippant, serjo, I don't think they coulda been friends.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  That is your master's library?  Would you mind if I looked in?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Please, serjo, go wherever you want.  We got nothing to hide.  We're loyal Imperial subjects.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: As, I hear, are all Telvanni.<BR>
<BR>
(Note from the playwright: this line should be delivered without sarcasm.  Trust the audience to laugh -- it never fails, regardless of the politics of the locals.)<BR>
<BR>
Clavides enters the library and looks over the books.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  The library needs dusting.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Yes, serjo.  I was just doing that when you knocked at the door.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I'm grateful for that.  If you had finished, I wouldn't notice the space in the dust where a rather large book has recently been removed.  Your master is a wizard, it seems.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  No, serjo.  I mean, he studies a lot, but he don't cast no spells, if that's what you mean by wizard.  He's a kena, went to college and everything.  You know, now that I think about it, I know what happened to that book.  One of the other kenas from the college been round yesterday, and borrowed a couple of books.  He's a friend of the master, so I thought it'd be all fine.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  This kena, was his name Warvim?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Coulda been.  I don't remember.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  There is a suspected necromancer at the college named Kena Warvim we arrested last night.  We don't know what he was doing at the college, but it was something illegal, that's for certain.  Was that the kena who borrowed the book?  A little fellow, a cripple with a withered leg?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  No, serjo, it weren't the kena from yesterday.  He was a big fella who could walk, so I noticed.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: I'm going to have a look around the rest of the house, if you don't mind.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides goes up the stairs, and delivers the following dialogue from the landing and the rooms above.  Anara continues straightening up the downstairs, moving a high-backed bench in front of the armor to scrub the floor.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Can I ask, serjo, what you're looking for?  Maybe I could help you.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Are these all the rooms in the castle?  No secret passages?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA (laughing):  Oh, serjo, what would Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr want with secret passages?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (looking at the armor):  Your master is a big man.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA (laughing):  Oh, serjo, don't tease.  That's giant armor, just for decoration.  My master slew that giant ten years ago, and kind of keeps it for a souvenir.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  That's right, I remember hearing something about that when I first took my post here.  It was someone named Xyr who killed the giant, but I didn't think the first name was Hordalf.  Memory fades I'm afraid.  What was the giant's name?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I'm afraid I don't remember, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I do.  It was Torfang.  $93I got out of Torfang's Shield.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I don't understand, serjo.  Torfang's shield?<BR>
<BR>
Clavides runs down the stairs, and examines the armor.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Sul-Kharifa said something about getting out of Torfang's shield.  I thought he was just raving, out of his mind.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  But he ain't got a shield, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides pushes the high-backed bench out of the way, revealing the large mounted shield at the base of the armor.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Yes, he does.  You covered it up with that bench.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I didn't do it on purpose, serjo!  I was just cleaning!  I see that armor ever day, serjo, and b'vek I swear I ain't never noticed the shield before!<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It's fine, Anara, I believe you.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides pushes on the shield and it pulls back to reveal a tunnel down.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It appears that Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr does have a need for a secret passage.  Could you get me a torch?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  B'vek, I ain't never seen that before!<BR>
<BR>
Anara takes a torch from the wall, and hands it to Clavides.  Clavides enters the tunnel.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Wait here.<BR>
<BR>
Anara watches Clavides disappear down the tunnel.  She appears agitated, and finally runs for the front door.  When she opens it, ULLIS, an Argonian lieutenant in the Imperial guard is standing at the entrance.  She screams.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  I'm sorry to frighten you.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Not now!  Go away!<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  I'm afraid the Captain wouldn't like that, miss.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  You're ... with the Captain?  Blessed mother.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides comes out of the tunnel, white-faced.  It takes him a few moments to speak.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Captain?  What's down there?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (to Anara):  Did you know your master's a necromancer?  That your cellar is filled with bodies?<BR>
<BR>
Anara faints.  Ullis carries her to the bench and lays her down.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Let me see, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  You'll see soon enough.  We're going to need every soldier from the post here to cart away all the corpses.  Ullis, I've seen enough battles, but I've never seen anything like this.  No two are alike.  Khajiiti, sload, dunmer, cyrodiil, breton, nord, burned alive, poisoned, electrified, melted, torn apart, turned inside out, ripped to shreds and sewn back up together.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  You think the ashlander escaped, that's what happened?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I don't know.  Why would someone do something like this, Ullis?<BR>
<BR>
There is a knock on the door.  Clavides answers it.  A young Argonian woman, ZOLLASSA, is standing, holding a package and a letter.<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Good morning, you're not Lord Xyr, are you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  No.  What do you have there?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  A letter and a package I'm supposed to deliver to him.  Will he be back shortly?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I don't believe so.  Who gave you the package to deliver?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  My teacher at the college, Kema Warvim.  He has a bad leg, so he asked me to bring these to his lordship.  Actually, to tell you the truth, I was supposed to deliver them last night, but I was busy.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Greetings, sistre.  We'll give the package to his lordship when we see him.<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Ah, hail, brothre.  I had heard there was a handsome Argonian in Scath Anud.  Unfortunately, I promised Kema Warvim that I'd deliver the package directly to his lordship's hands.  I'm already late, I can't just --<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  We're Imperial Guard, miss.  We will take the package and the letter.<BR>
<BR>
Zollassa reluctantly hands Clavides the letter and the package.  She turns to go.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  You're at the college, if we need to see you?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Yes.  Fare tidings, brothre.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Goodnight, sistre.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides opens the package as Zollassa exits.  It is a book with many loose sheets.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It appears we've found the missing book.  Delivered to our very hands.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides begins to read the book, silently to himself.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (to himself, very pleased):  Another Argonian in Scath Anud.  And a pretty one, at that.  I hope we weren't too rude to her.  I'm tired of all these women with their smooth, wet skin, it would be wonderful if we could meet when I'm off duty.  <BR>
<BR>
While Ullis talks, he opens the letter and reads it.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (continued):  She looks like she's from the south, like me.  You know, Argonians from northern Black Marsh are... much... less...<BR>
<BR>
Ullis continues reading, transfixed by the letter.  Clavides skips to the back of the book, and reads the last sentences.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (reading): In black ink $93The Khajiiti male showed surprisingly little fortitude to a simple lightning spell, but I've had interesting physiological results with a medium-level acid spell cast slowly over several days.$94  In red ink on the margins, $93Yes, I see.  Was the acid spell cast uniformly over the entire body of the subject?$94  In black ink $93The Nord female was subjected to sixteen hours of a frost spell which eventually crystallized her into a state of suspended animation, from which she eventually expired.  Not so the Nord male, nor the Ashlander male who lapsed into their comas much earlier, but then recovered.  The Ashlander then tried to escape, but I restrained him.  The Nord then had an interesting chemical overreaction to a simple fire spell and expired.  See the accompanying illustration.$94  In red ink, $93Yes, I see.  The pattern of boils and lesions suggest some sort of internal incineration perhaps caused by the combination of a short burst of flame following a longer session with frost.  It's such a shame I can't come to see the experiment personally, but I compliment you on your excellent notation.$94  In black ink, $93Thank you for the suggestion about slowly poisoning my maid Anara.  The dosages you've suggested have had fascinating results, eroding her memory very subtly.  I intend to increase it exponentially and see how long it is before she notices.  Speaking of which, it is a pity that I haven't any Argonian subjects, but the slave-traders promise me some healthy specimens in the autumn.  I should like to test their metabolism in comparison to elves and humans.  It's my theory that a medium-level lightning spell cast in a continuous wave on an Argonian wouldn't be lethal for several hours at least, similiar to my results with the Cyrodilic female and, of course, the giant.$94  In red ink, $93It'd be a shame to wait until autumn to see.$94<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (reading the letter):  In red ink, $93Here is your Argonian.  Please let me know the results.$94  It's signed $93Kema Warvim.$94<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  By Kynareth, this isn't necromancy.  It's Destruction.  Kema Warvim and Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr haven't been experimenting with death, but with the limits of magical torture.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  The letter isn't addressed to Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr.  It's addressed to Sedura Iachilla Xyr.  His wife, do you think?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Iachilla.  That was the Telvanni of the Xyr family who I heard about in connection with the giant slaying.  We'd best get the maid out of here.  She'll need to go to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides wakes up Anara.  She appears disoriented.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  What's happening?  Who are you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Don't worry, everything is going to be fine.  We're going to take you to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Do you need a coat, Iachilla?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Thank you, no, I'm not cold --<BR>
<BR>
Anara/Iachilla stops, realizing that she's been caught.  Clavides and Ullis unsheathe their blades.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  You have black ink on your fingers, your ladyship.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  And when you saw me at the door, you thought I was the Argonian your friend Warvim sent over.  That's why you said, $93Not now.  Go away.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA/IACHILLA:  You're much more observant than Anara.  She never did understand what was happening, even when I tripled the poison spell and she expired in what I observed as considerable agony.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  What were you going to use on me first, lightning or fire?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA/IACHILLA:  Lightning.  I find fire to be too unpredictable.<BR>
<BR>
As she speaks, the flames in the torches extinguish.  The stage is utterly dark.<BR>
<BR>
There is the sound of a struggle, swords clanging.  Suddenly a bolt of lightning flashes out, and there is silence.  From the darkness, Anara/Iachilla speaks.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA/IACHILLA: Fascinating.<BR>
<BR>
There are several more flashes of lightning as the curtain closes.<BR>
<BR>
THE END.<BR>

Breathing Water<BR>
by Haliel Myrm<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
He walked through the dry, crowded streets of Bal Fell, glad to be among so many strangers.  In the wharfs of Vivec, he had no such anonymity.  They knew him to be a smuggler, but here, he could be anyone.  A lower-class peddler perhaps.  A student even.  Some people even pushed against him as he walked past as if to say, $93We would not dream of being so rude as to acknowledge that you don't belong here.$94<BR>
<BR>
Seryne Relas was not in any of the taverns, but he knew she was somewhere, perhaps behind a tenement window or poking around in a dunghill for an exotic ingredient for some spell or another.  He knew little of the ways of sorceresses, but that they always seemed to be doing something eccentric.  Because of this prejudice, he nearly passed by the old Dunmer woman having a drink from a well.  It was too prosaic, but he knew from the look of her that she was Seryne Relas, the great sorceress.<BR>
<BR>
$93I have gold for you,$94 he said to her back. $93If you will teach me the secret of breathing water.$94<BR>
<BR>
She turned around, a wide wet grin stretched across her weathered features. $93I ain't breathing it, boy.  I'm just having a drink.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Don't mock me,$94 he said, stiffly. $93Either you're Seryne Relas and you will teach me the spell of breathing water, or you aren't.  Those are the only possibilities.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93If you're going to learn to breath water, you're going to have to learn there are more possibilities than that, boy.   The School of Alteration is all about possibilities, changing patterns, making things be what they could be.  Maybe I ain't Seryne Relas, but I can teach how to breathe water,$94 she wiped her mouth dry. $93Or maybe I am Seryne Relas and I won't.  Or maybe even I can teach you to breath water, but you can't learn.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I'll learn,$94 he said, simply.<BR>
<BR>
$93Why don't you just buy yourself a spell of water breathing or a potion over at the Mages Guild?$94 she asked.  $93That's how it's generally done.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93They're not powerful enough,$94 he said. $93I need to be underwater for a long time.  I'm willing to pay whatever you ask, but I don't want any questions.  I was told you could teach me.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What's your name, boy?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93That's a question,$94 he replied.  His name was Tharien Winloth, but in Vivec, they called him the Tollman.  His job, such as it was, was collecting a percentage of the loot from the smugglers when they came into harbor to bring to his boss in the Camonna Tong.  Of the value of that percentage, he earned another percentage.  In the end it was very small indeed.  He had scarcely any gold of his own, and what he had, he gave to Seryne Relas.<BR>
<BR>
The lessons began that very day.  The sorceress brought her pupil, who she simply called $93boy,$94 out to a low sandbank along the sea.<BR>
<BR>
$93I will teach you a powerful spell for breathing water,$94 she said. $93But you must become a master of it.  As with all spells and all skills, you more you practice, the better you get.  Even that ain't enough.  To achieve true mastery, you must understand what it is you're doing.  It ain't simply enough to perform a perfect thrust of a blade -- you must also know what you are doing and why.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93That's common sense,$94 said Tharien<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, it is,$94 said Seryne, closing her eyes. $93But the spells of Alteration are all about uncommon sense.  The infinite possibilities, breaking the sky, swallowing space, dancing with time, setting ice on fire, believing that the unreal may become real.  You must learn the rules of the cosmos and then break them.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93That sounds ... very difficult,$94 replied Tharien, trying to keep a straight face.<BR>
<BR>
Seryne pointed to the small silver fish darting along the water's edge: $93They don't find it so.  They breath water just fine.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93But that's not magic.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What I'm saying to you, boy, is that it is.$94<BR>
<BR>
For several weeks, Seryne drilled her student, and the more he understood about what he was doing and the more he practiced, the longer he could breath underwater.  When he found that he could cast the spell for as long as he needed, he thanked the sorceress and bade her farewell.<BR>
<BR>
$93There is one last lesson I have to teach you,$94 she said. $93You must learn that desire is not enough.  The world will end your spell no matter how good you are, and no matter how much you want it.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93That's a lesson I'm happy not to learn,$94 he said, and left at once for the short journey back to Vivec.<BR>
<BR>
The wharfs were much the same, with all the same smells, the same sounds, and the same characters.  His boss had found a new Tollman, he learned from his mates. They were still looking out for the smuggler ship Morodrung, but they had given up hope of ever seeing it.   Tharien knew they would not.  He had seen it sink from the wharf a long time ago.<BR>
<BR>
On a moonless night, he cast his spell and dove into the thrashing purple waves.  He kept his mind on the world of possibilities, that books could sing, that green was blue, that that water was air, that every stroke and kick brought him closer to a sunken ship filled with treasure.  He felt magicka surge all around him as he pushed his way deeper down.  Ahead he saw a ghostly shadow of the Morodrung, its mast billowing in a wind of deep water currents.  He also felt his spell begin to fade.  He could break reality long enough to breath water all the way back up to the surface, but not enough to reach the ship.<BR>
<BR>
The next night, he dove again, and this time, the spell was stronger.  He could see the vessel in detail, clouded over and dusted in sediment.  The wound in its hull where it had struck the reef.  A glint of gold beckoning from within.  But still he felt reality closing in, and he had to surface.<BR>
<BR>
The third night, he made it into the steerage, past the bloated corpses of the sailors, nibbled and picked apart by fish.  Their glassy eyes bulging, their mouths stretched open.  Had they only known the spell, he thought briefly, but his mind was more occupied by the gold scattered along the floor, the boxes that contained them shattered.  He considered scooping as much he could carry into his pockets, but a sturdy iron box seemed to bespeak more treasures.<BR>
<BR>
On the wall was a row of keys.  He took each down and tried it on the locked box, but none opened it.  One key, however, was missing.  Tharien looked around the room.  Where could it be?  His eyes went to the corpse of one of the sailors, floating in a dance of death not far from the box, his hands tightly clutching something.  It was a key.  When the ship had begun to sink, this sailor had evidently gone for the iron box.  Whatever was in it had to be very valuable.<BR>
<BR>
Tharien took the sailor's key and opened the box.  It was filled with broken glass.  He rummaged around until he felt something solid, and pulled out two flasks of some kind of wine.  He smiled as he considered the foolishness of the poor alcoholic.  This was what was important to the sailor, out of all the treasure in the Morodrung. <BR>
<BR>
Then, suddenly, Tharien Winloth felt reality.<BR>
<BR>
He had not been paying attention to the grim, tireless advance of the world on his spell.  It was fading away, his ability to breath water.  There was no time to surface.  There was no time to do anything.  As he sucked in, his lungs filled with cold, briny water.<BR>
<BR>
A few days later, the smugglers working on the wharf came upon the drowned body of the former Tollman.  Finding a body in the water in Vivec was not in itself noteworthy, but the subject that they discussed over many bottles of flin was how did it happen that he drowned with two potions of water breathing in his hands.<BR>

The Wolf Queen, Book Three<BR>
by Waughin Jarth<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
From the pen of the first century third era sage Montocai:<BR>
<FONT COLOR=""640F0F"" SIZE=""3"" FACE=""Magic Cards""><BR>
3E 98<BR>
The Emperor Pelagius Septim II died a few weeks before the end of the year, on the 15th of Evening Star during the festival of North Wind's Prayer, which was considered a bad omen for the Empire.  He had ruled over a difficult seventeen years.  In order to fill the bankrupt treasury, Pelagius had dismissed the Elder Council, forcing them to buy back their positions.  Several good but poor councilors had been lost.  Many say the Emperor had died as a result of being poisoned by a vengeful former Council member.<BR>
<BR>
His children came to attend his funeral and the coronation of the next Emperor.  His youngest son Prince Magnus, 19 years of age, arrived from Almalexia, where he had been a councilor to the royal court.  21-year-old Prince Cephorus arrived from Gilane with his Redguard bride, Queen Bianki.  Prince Antiochus at 43 years of age, the eldest child and heir presumptive, had been with his father in the Imperial City.  The last to appear was his only daughter, Potema, the so-called Wolf Queen of Solitude.  Thirty years old and radiantly beautiful, she arrived with a magnificent entourage, accompanied by her husband, the elderly King Mantiarco and her year-old son, Uriel.<BR>
<BR>
All expected Antiochus to assume the throne of the Empire, but no one knew what to expect from the Wolf Queen.<BR>

$93Lord Vhokken has been bringing several men to your sister's chambers late at night every night this week,$94 offered the Spymaster. $93Perhaps if her husband were made aware --$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My sister is a devotee of the conqueror gods Reman and Talos, not the love goddess Dibella.  She is plotting with those men, not having orgies with them.  I'd wager I've slept with more men than she has,$94 laughed Antiochus, and then grew serious. $93She's behind the delay of the council offering me the crown, I know it.  Six weeks now.  They say they need to update records and prepare for the coronation.  I'm the Emperor!  Crown me, and to Oblivion with the formalities!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Your sister is surely no friend of yours, your majesty, but there are other factors at play.  Do not forget how your father treated the Council.  It is they who need following, and if need be, strong convincing,$94 The Spymaster added, with a suggestive stab of his dagger.<BR>
<BR>
$93Do so, but keep your eye on the damnable Wolf Queen as well.  You know where to find me.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93At which brothel, your highness?$94 inquired the Spymaster.<BR>
<BR>
$93Today being Fredas, I'll be at the Cat and Goblin.$94<BR>
<BR>
The Spymaster noted in his report that night that Queen Potema had no visitors, for she was dining across the Imperial Garden at the Blue Palace with her mother, the Dowager Empress Quintilla.  It was a warm night for wintertide and surprisingly cloudless though the day had been stormy.  The saturated ground could not take any more, so the formal, structured gardens looked as if they had been glazed with water.  The two women took their wine to the wide balcony to look over the grounds.<BR>
<BR>
$93I believe you are trying to sabotage your half-brother's coronation,$94 said Quintilla, not looking at her daughter.  Potema saw how the years had not so much wrinkled her mother as faded her, like the sun on a stone.<BR>
<BR>
$93It's not true,$94 said Potema. $93But would it bother you very much if it were true?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Antiochus is not my son.  He was eleven years old when I married your father, and we've never been close.  I think that being heir presumptive has stunted his growth.  He is old enough to have a family with grown children, and yet he spends all his time at debauchery and fornication.  He will not make a very good Emperor,$94 Quintilla sighed and then turned to Potema. $93But it is bad for the family for seeds of discontent to be sown.  It is easy to divide up into factions, but very difficult to unite again.  I fear for the future of the Empire.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Those sound like the words -- are you, by any chance, dying, mother?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I've read the omens,$94 said Quintilla with a faint, ironic smile.  $93Don't forget -- I was a renowned sorceress in Camlorn.  I will dead in a few months time, and then, not a year later, your husband will die.  I only regret that I will not live to see your child Uriel assume the throne of Solitude.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Have you seen whether --$94 Potema stopped, not wanting to reveal too many of her plans, even to a dying woman.<BR>
<BR>
$93Whether he will be Emperor?  Aye, I know the answer to that too, daughter.  Don't fear: you'll live to see the answer, one way or the other.  I have a gift for him when he is of age,$94 The Dowager Empress removed a necklace with a single great yellow gem from around her neck.  $93It's a soul gem, infused with the spirit of a great werewolf your father and I defeated in battle thirty-six years ago.  I've enchanted it with spells from the School of Illusion so its wearer may charm whoever he chooses.  An important skill for a king.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93And an emperor,$94 said Potema, taking the necklace. $93Thank you, mother.$94<BR>
<BR>
An hour later, passing the black branches of the sculpted douad shrubs, Potema noticed a dark figure, which vanished into the shadows under the eaves at her approach.  She had noticed people following her before: it was one of the hazards of life in the Imperial court.  But this man was too close to her chambers.  She slipped the necklace around her neck.<BR>
<BR>
$93Come out where I can see you,$94 she commanded.<BR>
<BR>
The man emerged from the shadows.  A dark little fellow of middle-age dressed in black-dyed goatskin.  His eyes were fixed, frozen, under her spell.<BR>
<BR>
$93Who do you work for?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Prince Antiochus is my master,$94 he said in a dead voice. $93I am his spy.$94<BR>
<BR>
A plan formed.  $93Is the Prince in his study?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93No, milady.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93And you have access?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, milady.$94<BR>
<BR>
Potema smiled widely.  She had him.  $93Lead the way.$94<BR>
<BR>
The next morning, the storm reappeared in all its fury.  The pelting on the walls and ceiling was agony to Antiochus, who was discovering that he no longer had his youthful immunity to a late night of hard drinking. He shoved hard against the Argonian wench sharing his bed.<BR>
<BR>
$93Make yourself useful and close the window,$94 he moaned.<BR>
<BR>
No sooner had the window been bolted then there was a knock at the door.  It was the Spymaster.  He smiled at the Prince and handed him a sheet of paper.<BR>
<BR>
$93What is this?$94 said Antiochus, squinting his eyes. $93I must still be drunk.  It looks like orcish.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I think you will find it useful, your majesty.  Your sister is here to see you.$94<BR>
<BR>
Antiochus considered getting dressed or sending his bedmate out, but thought better of it. $93Show her in.  Let her be scandalized.$94<BR>
<BR>
If Potema was scandalized, she did not show it.  Swathed in orange and silver silk, she entered the room with a triumphant smile, followed by the man-mountain Lord Vhokken.<BR>
<BR>
$93Dear brother, I spoke to my mother last night, and she advised me very wisely.  She said I should not battle with you in public, for the good of our family and the Empire.  Therefore,$94 she said, producing from the folds of her robe a piece of paper. $93I am offering you a choice.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93A choice?$94 said Antiochus, returning her smile. $93That does sound friendly.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Abdicate your rights to the Imperial throne voluntarily, and there is no need for me to show the Council this,$94 Potema said, handing her brother the letter. $93It is a letter with your seal on it, saying that you knew that your father was not Pelagius Septim II, but the royal steward Fondoukth.  Now, before you deny writing the letter, you cannot deny the rumors, nor that the Imperial Council will believe that your father, the old fool, was quite capable of being cuckolded.  Whether it's true or not, or whether the letter is a forgery or not, the scandal of it would ruin your chances of being the Emperor.$94<BR>
<BR>
Antiochus's face had gone white with fury.<BR>
<BR>
$93Don't fear, brother,$94 said Potema, taking back the letter from his shaking hands. $93I will see to it that you have a very comfortable life, and all the whores your heart, or any other organ, desires.$94<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly Antiochus laughed.  He looked over at his Spymaster and winked. $93I remember when you broke into my stash of Khajiiti erotica and blackmailed me.  That was close to twenty years ago.  We've got better locks now, you must have noticed.  It must have killed you that you couldn't use your own skills to get what you wanted.$94<BR>
<BR>
Potema merely smiled.  It didn't matter.  She had him.<BR>
<BR>
$93You must have charmed my servant here into getting you into my study to use my seal,$94 Antiochus smirked. $93A spell, perhaps, from your mother, the witch?$94<BR>
<BR>
Potema continued to smile.  Her brother was cleverer than she thought.<BR>
<BR>
$93Did you know that Charm spells, even powerful ones, only last so long?   Of course, you didn't.  You never were one for magic.  Let me tell you, a generous salary is a stronger motivation for keeping a servant in the long run, sister,$94 Antiochus took out his own sheet of paper. $93Now I have a choice for you.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What is that?$94 said Potema, her smile faltering.<BR>
<BR>
$93It looks like nonsense, but if you know what you're looking for, it's very clear.  It's a practice sheet -- your handwriting attempting to look like my handwriting.  It's a good gift you have.  I wonder if you haven't done this before, imitating another person's handwriting.  I understand a letter was found from your husband's dead wife saying that his first son was a bastard.  I wonder if you wrote that letter.  I wonder if I showed this evidence of your gift to your husband whether he would believe you wrote that letter.  In the future, dear Wolf Queen, don't lay the same trap twice.$94<BR>
<BR>
Potema shook her head, furious, unable to speak.<BR>
<BR>
$93Give me your forgery and go take a walk in the rain.  And then, later today, unhatch whatever other plots you have to keep me from the throne.$94  Antiochus fixed his eyes on Potema's. $93I will be Emperor, Wolf Queen.  Now go.$94<BR>
<BR>
Potema handed her brother the letter and left the room.  For a few moments, out in the hallway, she said nothing.  She merely glared at the slivers of rainwater dripping down the marble wall from a tiny, unseen crack.<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, you will, brother,$94 she said. $93But not for very long.$94<BR>
<BR>

Book Nine of <BR>
2920, The Last Year of the First Era<BR>
by Carlovac Townway<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
2 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Gideon, Black Marsh<BR>
<BR>
The Empress Tavia lay across her bed, a hot late summer wind she could not feel banging the shutters of her cell to and fro against the iron bars.  Her throat felt like it was on fire but still she sobbed, uncontrollably, wringing her last tapestry in her hands.  Her wailing echoed throughout the hollow halls of Castle Giovese, stopping maids in their washing and guards in their conversation.  One of her women came up the narrow stairs to see her mistress, but her chief guard Zuuk stood at the doorway and shook his head.<BR>
<BR>
$93She's just heard that her son is dead,$94 he said quietly.<BR>
<BR>
5 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
The Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>
<BR>
$93Your Imperial Majesty,$94 said the Potentate Versidue-Shaie through the door. $93You can open the door.  I assure you, you're perfectly safe.  No one wants to kill you.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Mara's blood!$94 came the Emperor Reman III's voice, muffled, hysterical, tinged with madness. $93Someone assassinated the Prince, and he was holding my shield!  They could have thought he was me!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93You're certainly correct, your Imperial Majesty,$94 replied the Potentate, expunging any mocking qualities from his voice while his black-slitted eyes rolled contemptuously. $93And we must find and punish the evildoer responsible for your son's death.  But we cannot do it without you.  You must be brave for your Empire.$94<BR>
<BR>
There was no reply.<BR>
<BR>
$93At the very least, come out and sign the order for Lady Rijja's execution,$94 called the Potentate. $93Let us dispose of the one traitor and assassin we know of.$94<BR>
<BR>
A brief pause, and then the sound of furniture scraping across the floor.  Reman opened the door just a crack, but the Potentate could see his angry, fearful face, and the terrible mound of ripped tissue that used to be his right eye.  Despite the best healers in the Empire, it was still a ghastly souvenir of the Lady Rijja's work in Thurzo Fortress.<BR>
<BR>
$93Hand me the order,$94 the Emperor snarled. $93I'll sign it with pleasure.$94<BR>
<BR>
6 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Gideon, Cyrodiil<BR>
<BR>
The strange blue glow of the will o' the wisps, a combination, so she'd be told, of swamp gas and spiritual energy, had always frightened Tavia as she looked out her window.  Now it seemed strangely comforting.  Beyond the bog lay the city of Gideon.  It was funny, she thought, that she had never stepped foot in its streets, though she had watched it ever day for seventeen years.<BR>
<BR>
$93Can you think of anything I've forgotten?$94 she asked, turning to look back on the loyal Kothringi Zuuk.<BR>
<BR>
$93I know exactly what to do,$94 he said simply.  He seemed to smile, but the Empress realized that it was only her own face reflected in his silvery skin.  She was smiling, and she didn't even realize it.<BR>
<BR>
$93Make certain you aren't followed,$94 she warned. $93I don't want my husband to know where my gold's been hiding all these years.  And do take your share of it.  You've been a good friend.$94<BR>
<BR>
The Empress Tavia stepped forward and dropped from sight into the mists.  Zuuk replaced the bars on the tower window, and threw a blanket over some pillows on her bed.  With any luck, they would not discover her body on the lawn until morning, at which time he hoped to be halfway to Morrowind.<BR>
<BR>
9 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Phrygias, High Rock<BR>
<BR>
The strange trees on all sides resembled knobby piles crowned with great bursts of reds, yellows, and oranges, like insect mounds caught fire.  The Wrothgarian mountains were fading into the misty afternoon.  Turala marveled at the sight, so alien, so different from Morrowind, as she plodded the horse forward into an open pasture.  Behind her, head nodding against his chest, Cassyr slept, cradling Bosriel.  For a moment, Turala considered jumping the low painted fence that crossed the field, but she thought better of it.  Let Cassyr sleep for a few more hours before giving him the reigns.<BR>
<BR>
As the horse passed into the field, Turala saw the small green house on the next hill, half-hidden in forest.  So picturesque was the image, she felt herself lull into a pleasant half-sleeping state.  A blast of a horn brought her back to reality with a shudder.  Cassyr opened his eyes.<BR>
<BR>
$93Where are we?$94 he hissed.<BR>
<BR>
$93I don't know,$94 Turala stammered, wide-eyed. $93What is that sound?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Orcs,$94 he whispered. $93A hunting party.  Head for the thicket quickly.$94<BR>
<BR>
Turala trotted the horse into the small collection of trees. Cassyr handed her the child and dismounted.  He began pulling their bags off next, throwing them into the bushes.  A sound started then, a distant rumbling of footfall, growing louder and closer.  Turala climbed off carefully and helped Cassyr unburden the horse.  All the while, Bosriel watched open-eyed.  Turala sometimes worried that her baby never cried.  Now she was grateful for it.  With the last of the luggage off, Cassyr slapped the horse's rear, sending it galloping into the field.  Taking Turala's hand, he hunkered down in the bushes.<BR>
<BR>
$93With luck,$94 he murmured. $93They'll think she's wild or belongs to the farm and won't go looking for the rider.$94<BR>
<BR>
As he spoke, a horde of orcs surged into the field, blasting their horns.  Turala had seen orcs before, but never in such abundance, never with such bestial confidence.  Roaring with delight at the horse and its confused state, they hastened past the timber where Cassyr, Turala, and Bosriel hid.  The wildflowers flew into the air at their stampede, powdering the air with seeds.  Turala tried to hold back a sneeze, and thought she succeeded.  One of the orcs heard something though, and brought another with him to investigate.<BR>
<BR>
Cassyr quietly unsheathed his sword, mustering all the confidence he could.  His skills, such as they were, were in spying, not combat, but he vowed to protect Turala and her babe for as long as he could.  Perhaps he would slay these two, he reasoned, but not before they cried out and brought the rest of the horde.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, something invisible swept through the bushes like a wind.  The orcs flew backwards, falling dead on their backs.  Turala turned and saw a wrinkled crone with bright red hair emerge from a nearby bush.<BR>
<BR>
$93I thought you were going to bring 'em right to me,$94 she whispered, smiling. $93Best come with me.$94<BR>
<BR>
The three followed the old woman through a deep crevasse of bramble bushes that ran through the field toward the house on the hill.  As they emerged on the other side, the woman turned to look at the orcs feasting on the remains of the horse, a blood-soaked orgy to the beat of multiple horns.<BR>
<BR>
$93That horse yours?$94 she asked.  When Cassyr nodded, she laughed loudly. $93That's rich meat, that is.  Those monsters'll have bellyaches and flatulence in the morning.  Serves 'em right.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Shouldn't we keep moving?$94 whispered Turala, unnerved by the woman's laughter.<BR>
<BR>
$93They won't come up here,$94 she grinned, looking at Bosriel who smiled back. $93They're too afraid of us.$94<BR>
<BR>
Turala turned to Cassyr, who shook his head. $93Witches.  Am I correct in assuming that this is Old Barbyn's Farm, the home of the Skeffington Coven?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93You are, pet,$94 the old woman giggled girlishly, pleased to be so infamous. $93I am Mynista Skeffington.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What did you do to those orcs?$94 asked Turala. $93Back there in the thicket?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Spirit fist right side the head,$94 Mynista said, continuing the climb up the hill.  Ahead of them was the farmhouse grounds, a well, a chicken coop, a pond, women of all ages doing chores, the laughter of children at play.  The old woman turned and saw that Turala did not understand. $93Don't you have witches where you come from, child?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93None that I know of,$94 she said.<BR>
<BR>
$93There are all sorts of wielders of magic in Tamriel,$94 she explained. $93The Psijics study magic like it's their painful duty.  The battlemages in the army on the other end of the scale hurl spells like arrows.  We witches commune and conjure and celebrate.  To fell those orcs, I merely whispered to the spirits of the air, Amaro, Pina, Tallatha, the fingers of Kynareth, and the breath of the world, with whom I have an intimate acquaintance, to smack those bastards dead.  You see, conjuration is not about might, or solving riddles, or agonizing over musty old scrolls.  It's about fostering relations.  Being friendly, you might say.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Well, we certainly appreciate you being friendly with us,$94 said Cassyr.<BR>
<BR>
$93As well you might,$94 coughed Mynista. $93Your kind destroyed the orc homeland two thousand years ago.  Before that, they never came all the way up here and bothered us.  Now let's get you cleaned up and fed.$94<BR>
<BR>
With that, Mynista led them into the farm, and Turala met the family of the Skeffington Coven.<BR>
<BR>
11 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
The Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>
<BR>
Rijja had not even tried to sleep the night before, and she found the somber music played during her execution to have a soporific effect.  It was as if she was willing herself to be unconscious before the ax stroke.  Her eyes were bound so she could not see her former lover, the Emperor, seated before her, glaring with his one good eye.  She could not see the Potentate Versidue-Shaie, his coil neatly wrapped beneath him, a look of triumph in his golden face.  She could feel, numbly, the executioner's hand touch her back to steady her.  She flinched like a dreamer trying to awake.  <BR>
<BR>
The first blow caught the back of her head and she screamed.  The next hacked through her neck, and she was dead.<BR>
<BR>
The Emperor turned to the Potentate wearily, $93Now that's done.  You said she had a pretty sister in Hammerfell named Corda?$94<BR>
<BR>
18 Hearth Fire, 2920<BR>
Dwynnen, High Rock<BR>
<BR>
The horse the witches had sold him was not as good as his old one, Cassyr considered.  Spirit worship and sacrifice and sisterhood might be all well and good for conjuring spirits, but it tends to spoil beasts of burden.  Still, there was little to complain about.  With the Dunmer woman and her child gone, he had made excellent time.  Ahead were the walls surrounding the city of his homeland.  Almost at once, he was set upon by his old friends and family.<BR>
<BR>
$93How went the war?$94 cried his cousin, running to the road. $93Is it true that Vivec signed a peace with the Prince, but the Emperor refuses to honor it?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93That's not how it was, was it?$94 asked a friend, joining them. $93I heard that the Dunmer had the Prince murdered and then made up a story about a treaty, but there's no evidence for it.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Isn't there anything interesting happening here?$94 Cassyr laughed. $93I really don't have the least interest in discussing the war or Vivec.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93You missed the procession of the Lady Corda,$94 said his friend. $93She came across the bay with full entourage and then east to the Imperial City.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93But that's nothing.  What was Vivec like?$94 asked his cousin eagerly. $93He supposed to be a living god.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93If Sheogorath steps down and they need another God of Madness, he'll do,$94 said Cassyr haughtily.<BR>
<BR>
$93And the women?$94 asked the lad, who had only seen Dunmer ladies on very rare occasions.<BR>
<BR>
Cassyr merely smiled.  Turala Skeffington flashed into his mind for an instant before fading away.  She would be happy with the coven, and her child would be well cared for.  But they were part of the past now, a place and a war he wanted to forget forever.  Dismounting his horse, he walked it into the city, chatting of trivial gossip of life on the Iliac Bay.<BR>

Interviews With Tapestrists<BR>
Volume Eighteen<BR>
Cherim's Heart of Anequina<BR>
by Livillus Perus<BR>
Professor at the Imperial University<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
Contemporary with Maqamat Lusign (interviewed in volume seventeen of this series) is the Khajiiti Cherim, whose tapestries have been hailed as masterpieces all over the Empire for nigh on thirty years now. His four factories located throughout Elsweyr make reproductions of his work, but his original tapestries command stellar prices.  The Emperor himself owns ten Cherim tapestries, and his representatives are currently negotiating the sale of five more.<BR>
<BR>
The muted use of color contrasted with the luminous skin tones of Cherim's subjects is a marked contrast with the old style of tapestry.  The subjects of his work in recent years have been fabulous tales of the ancient past: the Gods meeting to discuss the formation of the world; the Chimer following the Prophet Veloth into Morrowind;  the Wild Elves battling Morihaus and his legions at the White Gold Tower.  His earliest designs dealt with more contemporary subjects.  I had the opportunity to discuss with him one of his first masterpieces, The Heart of Anequina, at his villa in Orcrest.<BR>
<BR>
The Heart of Anequina presents an historic battle of the Five Year War between Elsweyr and Valenwood which raged from 3E 394 (or 3E 395, depending on what one considers to be the beginning of the war) until 3E 399.  In most fair accounts, the war lasted 4 years and 9 months, but artistic license from the great epic poets added an additional three months to the ordeal.<BR>
<BR>
The actual details of the battle itself, as interpreted by Cherim, are explicit.  The faces of a hundred and twenty Wood Elf archers can be differentiated one from the other, each registering fear at the approach of the Khajiiti army.  Their hauberks catch the dim light of the sun.  The menacing shadows of the Elsweyr battlecats loom on the hills, every muscle strained, ready to pounce in command.  It is not surprising that he got all the details right, because Cherim was in the midst of it, as a Khajiiti foot soldier.<BR>
<BR>
Every minute part of the Khajiiti medium-weight armor can be seen in the soldiers in the foreground.  The embroidered edging and striped patterns on the tunics.  Each lacquered plate on loose-fitting leather in the Elsweyr style.  The helmets of cloth and fluted silver.<BR>
<BR>
$93Cherim does not understand the point of plate mail,$94 said Cherim. $93It is hot, for one, like being both burned and buried alive. Cherim wore it at the insistence of our Nord advisors during the Battle of Zelinin, and Cherim couldn't even turn to see what my fellow Khajiit were doing.  Cherim did some sketches for a tapestry of the Battle of Zelinin, but Cherim finds that to make it realistic, the figures came out very mechanical, like iron golems or dwemer centurions.  Knowing our Khajiiti commanders, Cherim would not be surprised if giving up the heavy plate was more aesthetic than practical.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Elsweyr lost the Battle of Zelinin, didn't she?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, but Elsweyr won the war, starting at the next battle, the Heart of Anequina,$94 said Cherim with a smile. $93The tide turned as soon as we Khajiit sent our Nordic advisors back to Solitude.  We had to get rid of all the heavy armor they brought to us and find enough traditional medium armor our troops felt comfortable wearing. Obviously, the principle advantage of the medium armor was that we could move easily in it, as you can see from the natural stances of the soldiers in the tapestry.  <BR>
<BR>
$93Now if you look at this poor perforated Cathay-raht who just keeps battling on in the bottom background, you see the other advantage.  It seems strange to say, but one of the best features of medium armor is that an arrow will either deflect completely or pass all the way through. An arrow head is like a hook, made to stick where it strikes if it doesn't pass through.  A soldier in medium armor will find himself with a hole in his body and the bolt on the other side. Our healers can fix such a wound easily if it isn't fatal, but if the arrow still remains in the armor, as it does with heavier armor, the wound will be reopened every time the fellow moves. Unless the Khajiit strips off the armor and pulls out the arrow, which is what we had to do at the Battle of Zelinin. A difficult and time-consuming process in the heat of battle, to say the least.$94<BR>
<BR>
I asked him next, $93Is there a self portrait in the battle?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes,$94 Cherim said with another grin. $93You see the small figure of the Khajiit stealing the rings off the dead Wood Elf?  His back is facing you, but he has a brown and orange striped tail like Cherim's. Cherim does not say that all stereotypes about the Khajiit are fair, but Cherim must sometimes acknowledge them.$94<BR>
<BR>
A self-deprecating style in self-portraiture is also evident in the tapestries of Ranulf Hook, the next artist interviewed in volume nineteen of this series.<BR>

Chimarvamidium<BR>
Ancient Tales of the Dwemer, Part VI<BR>
By Marobar Sul<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
After many battles, it was clear who would win the War.  The Chimer had great skills in magick and bladery, but against the armored battalions of the Dwemer, clad in the finest shielding wrought by Jnaggo, there was little hope of their ever winning.   In the interests of keeping some measure of peace in the Land, Sthovin the Warlord agreed to a truce with Karenithil Barif the Beast.  In exchange for the Disputed Lands, Sthovin gave Barif a mighty golem, which would protect the Chimer's territory from the excursions of the Northern Barbarians.<BR>
<BR>
Barif was delighted with his gift and brought it back to his camp, where all his warriors gaped in awe at it.  Sparkling gold in hue, it resembled a Dwemer cavalier with a proud aspect.  To test its strength, they placed the golem in the center of an arena and flung magickal bolts of lightning at it.  Its agility was such that few of the bolts struck it.  It had the wherewithal to pivot on its hips to avoid the brunt of the attacks without losing its balance, feet firmly planted on the ground.  A vault of fireballs followed, which the golem ably dodged, bending its knees and its legs to spin around the blasts.  The few times it was struck, it made certain to be hit in the chest and waist, the strongest parts of its body.<BR>
<BR>
The troops cheered at the sight of such an agile and powerful creation.  With it leading the defense, the Barbarians of Skyrim would never again successfully raid their villages.  They named it Chimarvamidium, the Hope of the Chimer.<BR>
<BR>
Barif has the golem brought to his chambers with all his housethanes.  There they tested Chimarvamidium further, its strength, its speed, its resiliency.  They could find no flaw with its design.<BR>
<BR>
$93Imagine when the naked barbarians first meet this on one of their raids,$94 laughed one of the housethanes.<BR>
<BR>
$93It is only unfortunate that it resembles a Dwemer instead of one of our own,$94 mused Karenithil Barif. $93It is revolting to think that they will have a greater respect for our other enemies than us.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I think we should never accepted the peace terms that we did,$94 said another, one of the most aggressive of the housethanes. $93Is it too late to surprise the warlord Sthovin with an attack?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93It is never too late to attack,$94 said Barif. $93But what of his great armored warriors?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I understand,$94 said Barif's spymaster. $93That his soldiers always wake at dawn.  If we strike an hour before, we can catch them defenseless, before they've had a chance to bathe, let alone don their armor.$94 <BR>
<BR>
$93If we capture their armorer Jnaggo, then we too would know the secrets of blacksmithery,$94 said Barif. $93Let it be done.  We attack tomorrow, an hour before dawn.$94<BR>
<BR>
So it was settled.  The Chimer army marched at night, and swarmed into the Dwemer camp.  They were relying on Chimarvamidium to lead the first wave, but it malfunctioned and began attacking the Chimer's own troops.  Added to that, the Dwemer were fully armored, well-rested, and eager for battle.  The surprise was turned, and most of the high-ranking Chimer, including Karenithil Barif the Beast, were captured.<BR>
<BR>
Though they were too proud to ask, Sthovin explained to them that he had been warned of their attack by a Calling by one of his men.<BR>
<BR>
$93What man of yours is in our camp?$94 sneered Barif.<BR>
<BR>
Chimarvamidium, standing erect by the side of the captured, removed its head.  Within its metal body was Jnaggo, the armorer.<BR>
<BR>
$93A Dwemer child of eight can create a golem,$94 he explained. $93But only a truly great warrior and armorer can pretend to be one.$94<BR>
<BR>
Publisher's Note:<BR>
<BR>
This is one of the few tales in this collection, which can actually be traced to the Dwemer. The wording of the story is quite different from older versions in Aldmeris, but the essence is the same. ""Chimarvamidium"" may be the Dwemer ""Nchmarthurnidamz."" This word occurs several times in plans of Dwemer armor and Animunculi, but its meaning is not known. It is almost certainly not ""Hope of the Chimer,"" however. <BR>
<BR>
The Dwemer were probably the first to use heavy armors. It is important to note how a man dressed in armor could fool many of the Chimer in this story. Also note how the Chimer warriors react. When this story was first told, armor that covered the whole body must have still been uncommon and new, whereas even then, Dwemer creations like golems and centurions were well known.<BR>
<BR>
In a rare scholarly moment, Marobar Sul leaves a few pieces of the original story intact, such as parts of the original line in Aldmeris, ""A Dwemer of eight can create a golem, but an eight of Dwemer can become one.""<BR>
<BR>
Another aspect of this legend that scholars like myself find interesting is the mention of $93the Calling.$94  In this legend and in others, there is a suggestion that the Dwemer race as a whole had some sort of silent and magickal communication. There are records of the Psijic Order which suggest they, too, share this secret. Whatever the case, there are no documented spells of ""calling."" The Cyrodiil historian Borgusilus Malier first proposed this as a solution to the disappearance of the Dwemer.  He theorized that in 1E 668, the Dwemer enclaves were called together by one of their powerful philosopher-sorcerers (""Kagrnak"" in some documents) to embark on a great journey, one of such sublime profundity that they abandoned all their cities and lands to join the quest to foreign climes as an entire culture.<BR>

The Thirty-Six Lessons of Vivec: Sermon Twenty<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
The first monster was actually two, having been born twice like his mother-father, Vivec. He was not the mightiest of the eight to escape Muatra, but his actions were the most worrisome. He was known as Moon Axle, and he harvested the leftovers foibles of nature. This he did twice, as was said, and the second harvest always brought ruin or unwritten law. His aspect was faceted like a polyhedron. <BR>
<BR>
No perils are mentioned in the finding of Moon Axle, but it was known that he was immune to spears, so Vivec had to use the sword not held against him. Before he took issue with the monster, the warrior-poet asked:<BR>
<BR>
'How came you to be immune to spears?'<BR>
<BR>
To which Moon Axle replied, 'Mine is a dual nature, and protean. I am in fact made of many straight lines, though none last too long. In this way I have learned to ignore all true segments.'<BR>
<BR>
Luckily, the sword not held was curved and therefore could cut into Moon Axle, and before the sun was up he was bleeding from many wounds. Vivec did not slay him outright for to do so would to keep the foibles of nature within him and not back where they belonged. Soon Vivec had traced geography right again, and Moon Axle was ready to be slain.<BR>
<BR>
Vivec rose up in his giant-form, to be terrible to look upon. He reached into the west and pulled out a canyon, holding it like a horn. He reached east and ate a handful of nix-hounds. Blowing their spirits through the canyon made a terrible wail, not unlike an unsolved woman. He said:<BR>
<BR>
'Let this overtake you,' and Moon Axle was overtaken by the curvatures of stolen souls. They wrapped about the monster like resin, until finally he could not move, nor could his dual nature.<BR>
<BR>
Vivec said, 'Now you are solved,' and pierced his child with Muatra. Moon Axle had been reduced to something static, and therefore shattered.<BR>
<BR>
The lines of Moon Axle were collected by Velothi philosophers and taken into caves. There, and for a year, Vivec taught the philosophers how to turn the lines of his son into the spokes of mystery wheels. This was the birth of the first Whirling School. Before, there had only been the surface thought of fire.<BR>
<BR>
Vivec looked at his first wheeling students and observed:<BR>
<BR>
'Alike the egg-layered universe is this morbid possession of three-distant coverage, soul-wrecked and alive, like my name is alive. In this cloister you have discovered one walking path, hilled like a sword but more coarsened. So edged it is that it has to be whispered to keep the tongue from bleeding, where its signs evacuate their former meanings, like empires that tarry too long.<BR>
<BR>
'The sword is estrangement from statesmanship.<BR>
<BR>
'Look on the estimable lines of my son, now crafted star-wise, his every limb equidistant from the center. Is he solved because I will it so? There cannot be a second stage. Think on the theory that my existence promulgates the five elements and alike the egg-layered universe I am cause for great density. Here is a thought that can break the wagon's axle; here is another that can soar.'<BR>
<BR>
The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.<BR>

A Dance In Fire, Chapter I <BR>
by Waughin Jarth<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
Scene: The Imperial City, Cyrodiil<BR>
Date: 7 Frost Fall, 3E 397<BR>
<BR>
It seemed as if the palace had always housed the Atrius Building Commission, the company of clerks and estate agents who authored and notarized nearly every construction of any note in the Empire.  It had stood for two hundred and fifty years, since the reign of the Emperor Magnus, a plain-fronted and austere hall on a minor but respectable plaza in the Imperial City.  Energetic and ambitious middle-class lads and ladies worked there, as well as complacent middle-aged ones like Decumus Scotti.  No one could imagine a world without the Commission, least of all Scotti.  To be accurate, he could not imagine a world without himself in the Commission.<BR>
<BR>
$93Lord Atrius is perfectly aware of your contributions,$94 said the managing clerk, closing the shutter that demarcated Scotti's office behind him. $93But you know that things have been difficult.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes,$94 said Scotti, stiffly.<BR>
<BR>
$93Lord Vanech's men have been giving us a lot of competition lately, and we must be more efficient if we are to survive.  Unfortunately, that means releasing some of our historically best but presently underachieving senior clerks.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I understand.  Can't be helped.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I'm glad that you understand,$94 smiled the managing clerk, smiling thinly and withdrawing. $93Please have your room cleared immediately.$94<BR>
<BR>
Scotti began the task of organizing all his work to pass on to his successor.  It would probably be young Imbrallius who would take most of it on, which was as it should be, he considered philosophically.  The lad knew how to find business.  Scotti wondered idly what the fellow would do with the contracts for the new statue of St Alessia for which the Temple of the One had applied.  Probably invent a clerical error, blame it on his old predecessor Decumus Scotti, and require an additional cost to rectify.<BR>
<BR>
$93I have correspondence for Decumus Scotti of the Atrius Building Commission.$94<BR>
<BR>
Scotti looked up.  A fat-faced courier had entered his office and was thrusting forth a sealed scroll.  He handed the boy a gold piece, and opened it up.  By the poor penmanship, atrocious spelling and grammar, and overall unprofessional tone, it was manifestly evident who the writer was.  Liodes Jurus, a fellow clerk some years before, who had left the Commission after being accused of unethical business practices.  <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=""640F0F"" SIZE=""3"" FACE=""Magic Cards""><BR>
$93Dear Sckotti,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I emagine you alway wondered what happened to me, and the last plase you would have expected to find me is out in the woods.  But thats exactly where I am.  Ha ha.  If your'e smart and want to make lot of extra gold for Lord Atrius (and yourself, ha ha), youll come down to Vallinwood too.  If you have'nt or have been following the politics hear lately, you may or may not know that ther's bin a war between the Boshmer and there neighbors Elswere over the past two years.  Things have only just calm down, and ther's a lot that needs to be rebuilt.<BR>
<BR>
Now Ive got more business than I can handel, but I need somone with some clout, someone representing a respected agencie to get the quill in the ink.  That somone is you, my fiend.  Come & meat me at the M'ther Paskos Tavern in Falinnesti, Vallinwood.  Ill be here 2 weeks and you wont be sorrie.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
-- Jurus<BR>
<BR>
P.S.: Bring a wagenload of timber if you can.$94<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR=""000000"" SIZE=""3"" FACE=""Magic Cards""><BR>
$93What do you have there, Scotti?$94 asked a voice.<BR>
<BR>
Scotti started.  It was Imbrallius, his damnably handsome face peeking through the shutters, smiling in that way that melted the hearts of the stingiest of patrons and the roughest of stonemasons.  Scotti shoved the letter in his jacket pocket.<BR>
<BR>
$93Personal correspondence,$94 he sniffed. $93I'll be cleared up here in a just a moment.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I don't want to hurry you,$94 said Imbrallius, grabbing a few sheets of blank contracts from Scotti's desk. $93I've just gone through a stack, and the junior scribes hands are all cramping up, so I thought you wouldn't miss a few.$94<BR>
<BR>
The lad vanished.  Scotti retrieved the letter and read it again.  He thought about his life, something he rarely did.  It seemed a sea of gray with a black insurmountable wall looming.  There was only one narrow passage he could see in that wall.  Quickly, before he had a moment to reconsider it, he grabbed a dozen of the blank contracts with the shimmering gold leaf ATRIUS BUILDING COMMISSION BY APPOINTMENT OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY and hid them in the satchel with his personal effects.<BR>
<BR>
The next day he began his adventure with a giddy lack of hesitation.   He arranged for a seat in a caravan bound for Valenwood, the single escorted conveyance to the southeast leaving the Imperial City that week.  He had scarcely hours to pack, but he remembered to purchase a wagonload of timber.<BR>
<BR>
$93It will be extra gold to pay for a horse to pull that,$94 frowned the convoy head.<BR>
<BR>
$93So I anticipated,$94 smiled Scotti with his best Imbrallius grin.<BR>
<BR>
Ten wagons in all set off that afternoon through the familiar Cyrodilic countryside.  Past fields of wildflowers, gently rolling woodlands, friendly hamlets.  The clop of the horses' hooves against the sound stone road reminded Scotti that the Atrius Building Commission constructed it.  Five of the eighteen necessary contracts for its completion were drafted by his own hand.<BR>
<BR>
$93Very smart of you to bring that wood along,$94 said a gray-whiskered Breton man next to him on his wagon. $93You must be in Commerce.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Of a sort,$94 said Scotti, in a way he hoped was mysterious, before introducing himself: $93Decumus Scotti.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Gryf Mallon,$94 said the man.  $93I'm a poet, actually a translator of old Bosmer literature.  I was researching some newly discovered tracts of the Mnoriad Pley Bar two years ago when the war broke out and I had to leave.  You are no doubt familiar with the Mnoriad, if you're aware of the Green Pact.$94<BR>
<BR>
Scotti thought the man might be speaking perfect gibberish, but he nodded his head.<BR>
<BR>
$93Naturally, I don't pretend that the Mnoriad is as renowned as the Meh Ayleidion, or as ancient as the Dansir Gol, but I think it has a remarkable significance to understanding the nature of the merelithic Bosmer mind.  The origin of the Wood Elf aversion to cutting their own wood or eating any plant material at all, yet paradoxically their willingness to import plantstuff from other cultures, I feel can be linked to a passage in the Mnoriad,$94 Mallon shuffled through some of his papers, searching for the appropriate text.<BR>
<BR>
To Scotti's vast relief, the carriage soon stopped to camp for the night.  They were high on a bluff over a gray stream, and before them was the great valley of Valenwood.  Only the cry of seabirds declared the presence of the ocean to the bay to the west: here the timber was so tall and wide, twisting around itself like an impossible knot begun eons ago, to be impenetrable.  A few more modest trees, only fifty feet to the lowest branches, stood on the cliff at the edge of camp.   The sight was so alien to Scotti and he found himself so anxious about the proposition of entering the wilderness that he could not imagine sleeping.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, Mallon had supposed he had found another academic with a passion for the riddles of ancient cultures.  Long into the night, he recited Bosmer verse in the original and in his own translation, sobbing and bellowing and whispering wherever appropriate.  Gradually, Scotti began to feel drowsy, but a sudden crack of wood snapping made him sit straight up.<BR>
<BR>
$93What was that?$94<BR>
<BR>
Mallon smiled: $93I like it too. 'Convocation in the malignity of the moonless speculum, a dance of fire --'$94<BR>
<BR>
$93There are some enormous birds up in the trees moving around,$94 whispered Scotti, pointing in the direction of the dark shapes above.<BR>
<BR>
$93I wouldn't worry about that,$94 said Mallon, irritated with his audience. $93Now listen to how the poet characterizes Herma-Mora's invocation in the eighteenth stanza of the fourth book.$94<BR>
<BR>
The dark shapes in the trees were some of them perched like birds, others slithered like snakes, and still others stood up straight like men.  As Mallon recited his verse, Scotti watched the figures softly leap from branch to branch, half-gliding across impossible distances for anything without wings.  They gathered in groups and then reorganized until they had spread to every tree around the camp.  Suddenly they plummeted from the heights.<BR>
<BR>
$93Mara!$94 cried Scotti. $93They're falling like rain!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Probably seed pods,$94 Mallon shrugged, not turning around. $93Some of the trees have remarkable --$94<BR>
<BR>
The camp erupted into chaos.  Fires burst out in the wagons, the horses wailed from mortal blows, casks of wine, fresh water, and liquor gushed their contents to the ground.  A nimble shadow dashed past Scotti and Mallon, gathering sacks of grain and gold with impossible agility and grace.  Scotti had only one glance at it, lit up by a sudden nearby burst of flame.  It was a sleek creature with pointed ears, wide yellow eyes, mottled pied fur and a tail like a whip.<BR>
<BR>
$93Werewolf,$94 he whimpered, shrinking back.<BR>
<BR>
$93Cathay-raht,$94 groaned Mallon. $93Much worse.  Khajiiti cousins or some such thing, come to plunder.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Are you sure?$94<BR>
<BR>
As quickly as they struck, the creatures retreated, diving off the bluff before the battlemage and knight, the caravan's escorts, had fully opened their eyes.  Mallon and Scotti ran to the precipice and saw a hundred feet below the tiny figures dash out of the water, shake themselves, and disappear into the wood.<BR>
<BR>
$93Werewolves aren't acrobats like that,$94 said Mallon. $93They were definitely Cathay-raht.  Bastard thieves.  Thank Stendarr they didn't realize the value of my notebooks.  It wasn't a complete loss.$94<BR>

The Rear-Guard<BR>
by Tenace Mourl<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
The castle would hold.  No matter the forces, the walls of Cascabel Hall would never fail, but that was small consolation for Menegur.  He was hungry.  In fact, he had never been so hungry.  The well in the atrium of the fortress supplied him with enough water to hold there until the Fourth Era, but his stomach reminded Menegur minute to minute that he needed food.<BR>
<BR>
The wagonload of supplies mocked him.  When his army, the forces of the King of Solitude, had left Cascabel Hall, and he had manned the battlements as the rear-guard to protect their retreat, they had left a wagon behind to supply him with enough food for months.  It was not until the night after they left that he inspected the larder and found that nothing edible was in the wagon.  Trunk after trunk was filled with netch armor from the army's incursion into Morrowind.  Apparently his Nord confederates had assumed that the lightly opaque material was hard tack in aspic.  If the Dunmer whose caravan had been raided knew about this, they would never be able to stop laughing.<BR>
<BR>
Menegur thought that his fellow mercenary and kinswoman Aerin would have found this amusing as well.  She had spoken with great authority about netch leather, being an expert of sorts on light armor, but she had made a point to mention that it could not be eaten like other leather in occasions of hardship.  It was a pity she couldn't be there to enjoy the irony, Menegur thought savagely.  She had returned to Morrowind even before the king's army had left, preferring a life as a wanted fugitive to a free existence in the cold of Skyrim.<BR>
<BR>
All the weeds in the courtyard had been devoured by the rear-guard's sixteenth day manning Cascabel Hall. The entire castle had been scoured: rotten tubers in the mulch pile found and consumed, a dusty bouquet in the countess's bedchamber eaten, almost every rat and insect but the most cunning infesting the castle walls had been tracked down and gobbled up. The castellan's chambers, filled with acrid, inedible law books, had yielded up a couple crumbs of bread. Menegur had even scraped moss from the stones.  There was no denying it: he would be dead from starvation before his army returned to break the ranks of the enemies who surrounded the fortress.<BR>
<BR>
$93The worst part,$94 said Menegur, who had taken to talking to himself on only the second day alone in the castle. $93Is how close sustenance is.$94<BR>
<BR>
A vast arbor of golden apples stretched acre after acre near the castle walls.  The sunlight cast a seductive gleam on the fruit, and the cruel wind carried sweet smells into Cascabel to torture him.<BR>
<BR>
Like most Bosmer, Menegur was an archer.  He was a master of long and medium distance fighting, but in close quarters, as he would be if he dared to leave the castle and enter the enemy camp in the arbor, he knew he would not last long.  At some point, he knew he would have to try, but he had been dreading the day.  It was upon him now.<BR>
<BR>
Menegur put on the netch armor for the first time, feeling the powdery, almost velvet texture of the rendered leather against his skin.  There was also a barely perceptible throb, which he recognized as the remnant nematocysts of the netch's venomous flesh, still tingling months after its death with domesticated poison. The combination made him feel energized. Aerin had described the sensation perfectly, just as she had explained how to defend himself while wearing netch leather armor.<BR>
<BR>
Under cover of night, Menegur crept out of the back gate of the castle, locking it behind him with a rather cumbersome key.  He made for the arbor as quietly as he could, but a passing sentry, coming behind a tree, saw him.  Remaining calm, Menegur did as he remembered Aerin had instructed, only moving after the attack had been launched.  The sentry's blade glided against the armor and knocked to the left, throwing the young man off balance.  That was the trick, as he understood it: you had to be prepared to be hit, and merely move with the blow, allowing the membranous armor to divert the injury away. <BR>
<BR>
Use your enemy's momentum against him, as Aerin used to say.<BR>
<BR>
There were several more close encounters in the arbor, but each swing of an ax and each thrust of a sword found purchase elsewhere.  With handfuls of apples, Menegur ran the gauntlet back to the castle.  He locked the back gate door behind him and fell into an orgy of eating.<BR>
<BR>
For week after week, the Bosmer stole out to gather his food.  The guards began anticipating his raids, but he kept his schedule irregular and always remembered when attacked to wait for the blow, accept it, and then turn.  In such a way, he lived and survived his lonely vigil in Cascabel Hall.<BR>
<BR>
Four months later, as he was preparing for another seizure of apples, Menegur heard a loud clamor at the front gate.  Surveying the group from a safe distance on the battlements, he saw the shields of the King of Solitude, his ally the Count of Cascabel, and their enemy the King of Farrun.  Evidently, a truce had been called.<BR>
<BR>
Menegur opened the gates and the combined armies flooded the courtyard.  Many of the knights of Farrun sought to shake the hand of the man they had named the Shadow of the Arbor, expressing their admiration at his defensive skills and apologizing good-naturedly for their attempts to slay him.  Only doing their job, you know.<BR>
<BR>
$93There's hardly a apple left on the vines,$94 said the King of Solitude.<BR>
<BR>
$93Well, I started on the edges and worked my way in,$94 explained Menegur. $93I brought back extra fruit to tempt the rats of out of walls so I could have a little meat as well.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93We've spent the last several months working out the details of the truce,$94 said the King. $93Really quite exhausting.  In any rate, the Count will be taking back possession of his castle now, but there is a small detail we need to work out.  You're a mercenary, and as such responsible for your own expenses.  If you had been a subject of mine, things might be different, but there are certain old rules of law that must be respected.$94<BR>
<BR>
Menegur anticipated the strike.<BR>
<BR>
$93The problem is,$94 the King continued. $93You've taken a good deal of the Count's crops while here.  By any reasonable computation, you've eaten an amount equal to and likely exceeding your mercenary's wages.  Obviously, I would not want to penalize you for the excellent job you've done defending the castle in uncomfortable circumstances, but you agree that it's important that we observe the old rules of law, don't you?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Of course,$94 replied Menegur, accepting the blow.<BR>
<BR>
$93I'm delighted to hear that,$94 said the King. $93Our estimation is that you owe the Count of Cascabel thirty-seven Imperial gold.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Which I will gladly pay to myself, with interest, after the autumntide harvest,$94 said Menegur. $93There is more left on the vine than you suggest.$94<BR>
<BR>
The Kings of Solitude and Farrun, and the Count of Cascabel stared at the Bosmer.<BR>
<BR>
$93We agreed to abide to the strictest old rules of law, and I've had time to read a great many books over the time you were making your truce.  In 3E 246, during the reign of Uriel IV, the Imperial Council, in an attempt to clear up some questions of property rights in Skyrim during those chaotic days, decreed that any man without a liege who occupied a castle for more than three months would be granted the rights and titles of that estate.  It's a good law, of course, meant to discourage absent and foreign landlords.$94  Menegur smiled, feeling the now familiar sensation of a glancing strike diverting. $93By the rule of law, I am the Count of Cascabel.$94<BR>
<BR>
The rear-guard's son still hold the title of Count of Cascabel.  And he grows the finest, most delectable apples in the Empire.<BR>

The Wolf Queen, Book Two<BR>
by Waughin Jarth<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
From the pen of the first century third era sage Montocai:<BR>
<FONT COLOR=""640F0F"" SIZE=""3"" FACE=""Magic Cards""><BR>
3E 82:<BR>
A year after the wedding of his 14-year-old granddaughter the Princess Potema to King Mantiarco of the Nordic kingdom of Solitude, the Emperor Uriel Septim II passed on.  His son Pelagius Septim II was made emperor, and he faced a greatly depleted treasury, thanks to his father's poor management.<BR>
<BR>
As the new Queen of Solitude, Potema faced opposition from the old Nordic houses, who viewed her as an outsider.  Mantiarco had been widowed, and his former queen was loved.  She had left him a son, Prince Bathorgh, who was two years older than his stepmother, and loved her not.  But the king loved his queen, and suffered with her through miscarriage after miscarriage, until her 29th year, when she bore him a son.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=""000000"" SIZE=""3"" FACE=""Magic Cards""><BR>
<BR>
3E 97<BR>
$93You must do something to help the pain!$94 Potema cried, baring her teeth.  The healer Kelmeth immediately thought of a she-wolf in labor, but he put the image from his mind.  Her enemies called her the Wolf Queen for certes, but not because of any physical resemblance.<BR>
<BR>
$93Your Majesty, there is no injury for me to heal.  The pain you feel is natural and helpful for the birth,$94 he was going to add more words of consolation, but he had to break off to duck the mirror she flung at him.<BR>
<BR>
$93I'm not a pignosed peasant girl!$94 She snarled, $93I am the Queen of Solitude, daughter of the Emperor!  Summon the daedra!  I'll trade the soul of every last subject of mine for a little comfort!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My Lady,$94 said the healer nervously, drawing the curtains and blotting out the cold morning sun. $93It is not wise to make such offers even in jest.  The eyes of Oblivion are forever watching for just such a rash interjection.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What would you know of Oblivion, healer?$94 she growled, but her voice was calmer, quieter.  The pain had relaxed.  $93Would you fetch me that mirror I hurled at you?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Are you going to throw it again, your Majesty?$94 said the healer with a taut smile, obeying her.<BR>
<BR>
$93Very likely,$94 she said, looking at her reflection. $93And next time I won't miss.  But I do look a fright.  Is Lord Vhokken still waiting for me in the hall?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, your Majesty.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Well, tell him I just need to fix my hair and I'll be with him.  And leave us.  I'll howl for you when the pain returns.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, your Majesty.$94<BR>
<BR>
A few minutes later, Lord Vhokken was shown into the chamber.  He was an enormous bald man whose friends and enemies called Mount Vhokken, and when he spoke it was with the low grumble of thunder.  The Queen was one of the very few people Vhokken knew who was not the least bit intimidated by him, and he offered her a smile.<BR>
<BR>
$93My queen, how are you feeling?$94 he asked.<BR>
<BR>
$93Damned.  But you're looking like Springtide has come to Mount Vhokken.  I take it from your merry disposition that you've been made warchief.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Only temporarily, while your husband the King investigates whether there is evidence behind the rumors of treason on the part of my predecessor Lord Thone.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93If you've planted it as I've instructed, he'll find it,$94 Potema smiled, propping herself up in the bed. $93Tell me, is Prince Bathorgh still in the city?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What a question, your highness,$94 laughed the mountain. $93It's the Tournament of Stamina today, you know the prince would never miss that.  The fellow invents new strategies of self-defense every year to show off during the games.  Don't you recall last year, where he entered the ring unarmored and after twenty minutes of fending off six bladesmen, left the games without a scratch?  He dedicated that bout to his late mother, Queen Amodetha.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Yes, I recall.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93He's no friend to me or you, your highness, but you must give the man his due respect. He moves like lightning.  You wouldn't think it of him, but he always seems to use his awkwardness to his advantage, to throw his opponents off.  Some say he learned the style from the orcs to the south.  They say he learned from them how to anticipate a foe's attack by some sort of supernatural power.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93There's nothing supernatural about it,$94 said the Queen, quietly. $93He gets it from his father.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Mantiarco never moved like that,$94 Vhokken chuckled.<BR>
<BR>
$93I never said he did,$94 said Potema.  Her eyes closed and her teeth gritted together. $93The pain's returning.  You must fetch the healer, but first, I must ask you one other thing -- has the new summer palace construction begun?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I think so, your Highness.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Do not think!$94 she cried, gripping the sheets, biting her lips so a stream of blood dripped down her chin. $93Do!  Make certain that the construction begins at once, today!  Your future, my future, and the future of this child depend on it!  Go!$94<BR>
<BR>
Four hours later, King Mantiarco entered the room to see his son.  His queen smiled weakly as he gave her a kiss on the forehead.  When she handed him the child, a tear ran down his face.  Another one quickly followed, and then another.<BR>
<BR>
$93My Lord,$94 she said fondly. $93I know you're sentimental, but really!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93It's not only the child, though he is beautiful, with all the fair features of his mother,$94 Mantiarco turned to his wife, sadly, his aged features twisted in agony. $93My dear wife, there is trouble at the palace.  In truth, this birth is the only thing that keeps this day from being the darkest in my reign.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What is it?  Something at the tournament?$94 Potema pulled herself up in bed. $93Something with Bathorgh?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93No, it isn't the tournament, but it does relate to Bathorgh.  I shouldn't worry you at a time like this.  You need your rest.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My husband, tell me!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I wanted to surprise you with a gift after the birth of our child, so I had the old summer palace completely renovated.  It's a beautiful place, or at least it was.  I thought you might like it.  Truth to tell, it was Lord Vhokken idea.  It used to be Amodetha's favorite place.$94  Bitterness crept into the king's voice. $93Now I've learned why.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What have you learned?$94 asked Potema quietly.<BR>
<BR>
$93Amodetha deceived me there, with my trusted warchief, Lord Thone.  There were letters between them, the most perverse things you've ever read.  And that's not the worst of it.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93No?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93The dates on the letters correspond with the time of Bathorgh's birth.  The boy I raised and loved as a son,$94 Mantiarco's voice choked up with emotion. $93He was Thone's child, not mine.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My darling,$94 said Potema, almost feeling sorry for the old man.  She wrapped her arms around his neck, as he heaved his sobs down on her and their child.<BR>
<BR>
$93Henceforth,$94 he said quietly. $93Bathorgh is no longer my heir.  He will be banished from the kingdom.  This child you have borne me today will grow to rule Solitude.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93And perhaps more,$94 said Potema. $93He is the Emperor's grandson as well.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93We will name him Mantiarco the Second.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93My darling, I would love that,$94 said Potema, kissing the king's tear-streaked face. $93But may I suggest Uriel, after my grandfather the Emperor, who brought us together in marriage?$94<BR>
<BR>
King Mantiarco smiled at his wife and nodded his head.  There was a knock at the door.<BR>
<BR>
$93My liege,$94 said Mount Vhokken. $93His highness Prince Bathorgh has finished the tournament and awaits you to present his award.  He has successfully withstood attacks by nine archers and the giant scorpion we brought in from Hammerfell.  The crowd is roaring his name.  They are calling him The Man Who Cannot Be Hit.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I will see him,$94 said King Mantiarco sadly, and left the chamber.<BR>
<BR>
$93Oh he can be hit, all right,$94 said Potema wearily. $93But it does take some doing.$94<BR>
<BR>

Varieties of Faith in the Empire<BR>
by Brother Mikhael Karkuxor of the Imperial College<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
This is my best attempt at a listing of the pantheons and associated divine spirits of Tamriel's dominant cultures. This list is by no means complete (the Imperial City of Cyrodiil alone boasts a vast host of saints and holy spirits). It only includes the most important spirits revered by native members of the culture. Other et'Ada, especially Daedra, are often familiar known to many cultures, though specific names are included here only when they possess a particular cultural significance. The omission of any reference to the worships of the Argonians of Black Marsh is a result of my complete inadequacy in reconciling the obscure and contradictory accounts available to me on that subject.<BR>

<BR>
NOTES ON THE DIVINE SPIRITS OF THE PANTHEONS<BR>
<BR>
Akatosh (Dragon God of Time): Akatosh is the chief deity of the Nine Divines (the major religious cult of Cyrodiil and its provinces), and one of two deities found in every Tamrielic religion (the other is Lorkhan). He is generally considered to be the first of the Gods to form in the Beginning Place; after his establishment, other spirits found the process of being easier and the various pantheons of the world emerged. He is the ultimate God of the Cyrodilic Empire, where he embodies the qualities of endurance, invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy. <BR>
<BR>
Alduin (World Eater): Alduin is the Nordic variation of Akatosh, and only superficially resembles his counterpart in the Nine Divines. For example, Alduin's sobriquet, 'the world eater', comes from myths that depict him as the horrible, ravaging firestorm that destroyed the last world to begin this one. Nords therefore see the god of time as both creator and harbinger of the apocalypse. He is not the chief of the Nordic pantheon (in fact, that pantheon has no chief; see Shor, below) but its wellspring, albeit a grim and frightening one.<BR>
<BR>
Alkosh (Dragon King of Cats): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity. A variation on the Altmeri Auri-El, and thus an Akatosh-as-culture-hero for the earliest Khajiiti. His worship was co-opted during the establishment of the Riddle-T'har, and he still enjoys immense popularity in Elsweyr's wasteland regions. He is depicted as a fearsome dragon, a creature the Khajiit say 'is just a real big cat'. He repelled an early Aldmeri pogrom of Pelinal Whitestrake during mythic times.<BR>
<BR>
Almalexia (Mother Morrowind): Most traces of Akatosh disappeared from ancient Chimer legends during their so-called 'exodus', primarily due to that god's association and esteem with the Altmeri. However, most aspects of Akatosh which seem so important to the mortal races, namely immortality, historicity, and genealogy, have conveniently resurfaced in Almalexia, the most popular of Morrowind's divine Tribunal.<BR>
<BR>
Arkay (God of the Cycle of Life and Death):  Member of the Nine Divines pantheon, and popular elsewhere as well. Arkay is often more important in those cultures where his father, Akatosh, is either less related to time or where his time aspects are difficult to comprehend by the layman. He is the god of burials and funeral rites, and is sometimes associated with the seasons. His priests are staunch opponents of necromancy and all forms of the undead. It is said that Arkay did not exist before the world was created by the gods under Lorkhan's supervision/urging/trickery. Therefore, he is sometimes called the Mortals' God. <BR>
<BR>
Auri-El (King of the Aldmer): The Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of Anui-El, who, in turn, is the soul of Anu the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons. Most Altmeri and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.<BR>
<BR>
Azura (Goddess of Dusk and Dawn): Azura was the god-ancestor that taught the Chimer the mysteries needed to be different than the Altmer. Some of her more conventional teachings are sometimes attributed to Boethiah. In the stories, Azura is often more a communal cosmic force for the race as a whole than an ancestor or a god. Also known as the Anticipation of Sotha Sil. In Elsweyr, Azurah is nearly a wholly separate entity, yet she is still tied into the origins of Khajiiti out of Altmeri stock.<BR>
<BR>
Baan Dar (The Bandit God): In most regions, Baan Dar is a marginal diety, a trickster spirit of thieves and beggars. In Elsweyr he is more important, and is regarded as the Pariah. In this aspect, Baan Dar becomes the cleverness or desperate genius of the long-suffering Khajiit, whose last minute plans always upset the machinations of their (Elven or Human) enemies.  <BR>
<BR>
Boethiah (Prince of Plots): Heralded by the Prophet Veloth, Boethiah is the original god-ancestor of the Dark Elves. Through his illuminations, the eventual 'Chimer', or Changed Folk, renounced all ties to the Aldmer and founded a new nation based on Daedric principles. All manner of Dark Elven cultural 'advances' are attributed to Boethiah, from philosophy to magic to 'responsible' architecture. Ancient Velothi allegories are uniformly heroic successes of Boethiah over enemies of every type, foundation stories of Chimeri struggle. Also known as the Anticipation of Almalexia. <BR>
<BR>
Diagna (Orichalc God of the Sideways Blade): Hoary thuggish cult of the Redguards. Originated in Yokuda during the Twenty Seven Snake Folk Slaughter. Diagna was an avatar of the HoonDing (the Yokudan God of Make Way, see below) that achieved permanence. He was instrumental to the defeat of the Lefthanded Elves, as he brought orichalc weapons to the Yokudan people to win the fight. In Tamriel, he led a very tight knit group of followers against the Orcs of Orsinium during the height of their ancient power, but then faded into obscurity. He is now little more than a local power spirit of the Dragontail mountains.<BR>
<BR>
Dibella (Goddess of Beauty): Popular god of the Nine Divines. In Cyrodiil, she has nearly a dozen different cults, some devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction. <BR>
<BR>
Herma-Mora (The Woodland Man): Ancient Atmoran demon who, at one time, nearly seduced the Nords into becoming Aldmer. Most Ysgramor myths are about escaping the wiles of old Herma-Mora. Also called the Demon of Knowledge, he is vaguely related to the cult origins of the Morag Tong ('Foresters Guild'), if only by association with his brother/sister, Mephala. <BR>
<BR>
HoonDing (The Make Way God): Yokudan spirit of 'perseverance over infidels'. The HoonDing has historically materialized whenever the Redguards need to 'make way' for their people. In Tamrielic history this has only happened three times -- twice in the first era during the Ra Gada invasion and once during the Tiber War. In this last incarnation, the HoonDing was said to have been either a sword or a crown, or both.<BR>
<BR>
Jhunal (Rune God): The Nordic god of hermetic orders. After falling out of favor with the rest of that pantheon, he became Julianos of the Nine Divines. He is absent in modern Skyrim mythology. <BR>
<BR>
Jode (Big Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Big Moon. Also called Masser or Mara's Tear. In Khajiiti religion, Jode is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.<BR>
<BR>
Jone (Little Moon God): Aldmeri god of the Little Moon. Also called Secunda or Stendarr's Sorrow. In Khajiiti religion, Jone is only one aspect of the Lunar Lattice, or ja-Kha'jay.<BR>
<BR>
Julianos (God of Wisdom and Logic): Often associated with Jhunal, the Nordic father of language and mathematics, Julianos is the Cyrodilic god of literature, law, history, and contradiction. Monastic orders founded by Tiber Septim and dedicated to Julianos are the keepers of the Elder Scrolls. <BR>
<BR>
Kyne (Kiss At the End): Nordic Goddess of the Storm. Widow of Shor and favored god of warriors. She is often called the Mother of Men. Her daughters taught the first Nords the use of the thu'um, or Storm Voice.<BR>
<BR>
Kynareth (Goddess of Air): Kynareth is a member of the Nine Divines, the strongest of the Sky spirits. In some legends, she is the first to agree to Lorkhan's plan to invent the mortal plane, and provides the space for its creation in the void. She is also associated with rain, a phenomenon said not to occur before the removal of Lorkhan's divine spark.<BR>
<BR>
Leki (Saint of the Spirit Sword): Goddess daughter of Tall Papa, Leki is the goddess of aberrant swordsmanship. The Na-Totambu of Yokuda warred to a standstill during the mythic era to decide who would lead the charge against the Lefthanded Elves. Their swordmasters, though, were so skilled in the Best Known Cuts as to be matched evenly. Leki introduced the Ephemeral Feint. Afterwards, a victor emerged and the war with the Aldmer began.<BR>
<BR>
Lorkhan (The Missing God): This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. His most popular name is the Aldmeri 'Lorkhan', or Doom Drum. He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo -- much like his father Padomay had introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his metaphysical placement in the 'scheme of things' is interpreted a variety of ways. In Morrowind, for example, he is a being related to the Psijiic Endeavor, a process by which mortals are charged with transcending the gods that created them. To the High Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero of early Mankind.<BR>
<BR>
Lorkhaj (Moon Beast): Pre-ri'Datta Dynasty Anaquinine deity, easily identified with the Missing God, Lorkhan. <BR>
<BR>
Magnus (Magus): The god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the last second, though it cost him dearly. What is left of him on the world is felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff. Cyrodilic legends say he can inhabit the bodies of powerful magicians and lend them his power. Associated with Zurin Arctus, the Underking.<BR>
<BR>
Malacath (God of Curses): Malacath is the reanimated dung that was Trinimac. A somewhat weak but vengeful Daedra, the Dark Elves say he is also Malak, the god-king of the orcs. He always tests the Dunmer for physical weakness.<BR>
<BR>
Malooc (Horde King): An enemy god of the Ra Gada. Led the goblins against the Redguards during the first era. Fled east when the army of the HoonDing overtook his goblin hordes.<BR>
<BR>
Mauloch (Malacath): An Orcish god, Mauloch troubled the heirs of King Harald for a long time. Fled east after his defeat at the Battle of Dragon Wall, ca. 1E660. His rage was said to fill the sky with his sulphurous hatred, later called the ""Year of Winter in Summer"".<BR>
<BR>
Mara (Goddess of Love): Nearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility goddess. In Skyrim, Mara is a handmaiden of Kyne. In the Empire, she is Mother-Goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the 'Anuad', the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. Depending on the religion, she is either married to Akatosh or Lorkhan, or the concubine of both.<BR>
<BR>
Mehrunes Dagon (God of Destruction): Popular Daedric power. He is associated with natural dangers like fire, earthquakes, and floods. In some cultures, though, Dagon is merely a god of bloodshed and betrayal. He is an especially important deity in Morrowind, where he represents its near-inhospitable terrain. <BR>
<BR>
Mephala (Androgyne):  Mephala is the Webspinner, or the Spider God. In Morrowind, he/she was the ancestor that taught the Chimer the skills they would need to evade their enemies or to kill them with secret murder. Enemies were numerous in those days since the Chimer were a small faction. He/she, along with Boethiah, organized the clan systems that eventually became the basis for the Great Houses. He/she founded the Morag Tong. Also called the Anticipation of Vivec. <BR>
<BR>
Molag Bal (God of Schemes, King of Rape): Daedric power of much importance in Morrowind. There, he is always the archenemy of Boethiah, the Prince of Plots. He is the main source of the obstacles to the Dunmer (and preceding Chimer) people. In the legends, Molag Bal always tries to upset the bloodlines of Houses or otherwise ruin Dunmeri 'purity'. A race of supermonsters, said to live in Molag Amur, are the result of his seduction of Vivec during the previous era.<BR>
<BR>
Morihaus (First Breath of Man): Ancient cultural hero god of the Cyro-Nordics. Legend portrays him as the Taker of the Citadel, an act of mythic times that established Human control over the Valley Heartland. He is often associated with the Nordic powers of thu'um, and therefore with Kynareth.<BR>
<BR>
Morwha (Teat God): Yokudan fertility goddess. Fundamental deity in the Yokudan pantheon, and the favorite of Tall Papa's wives. Still worshipped in various areas of Hammerfell, including Stros M'kai. Morwha is always portrayed as four-armed, so that she can 'grab more husbands'.<BR>
<BR>
Nerevar (Godkiller): The Chimeri king of Resdayn, the Golden Age of old Veloth. Slain during the Battle of Red Mountain, Nerevar was the Herald of the Triune Way, and is the foremost of the saints of Dunmeri faith. He is said to have killed Dumac, the Last Dwarven King, and feasted on his heart.<BR>
<BR>
Onsi (Boneshaver): Notable warrior god of the Yokudan Ra Gada, Onsi taught Mankind how to pull their knives into swords.<BR>
<BR>
Orkey (Old Knocker): A loan-god of the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during Aldmeri rule of Atmora. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that 'bound them to the count of winters'. At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Shor showed up, though, and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.<BR>
<BR>
Phynaster: Hero-god of the Summerset Isles, who taught the Altmer how to naturally live another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride.<BR>
<BR>
Rajhin (Footpad): Thief god of the Khajiiti, who grew up in the Black Kiergo section of Senchal. The most famous burglar in Elsweyr's history, Rajhin is said to have stolen a tattoo from the neck of Empress Kintyra as she slept.<BR>
<BR>
Reman (The Cyrodiil): Culture god-hero of the Second Empire, Reman was the greatest hero of the Akaviri Trouble. Indeed, he convinced the invaders to help him build his own empire, and conquered all of Tamriel except for Morrowind. He instituted the rites of becoming Emperor, which included the ritual geas to the Amulet of Kings, a soulgem of immense power. His Dynasty was ended by the Dunmeri Morag Tong at the end of the first era. Also called the Worldly God.<BR>
<BR>
Riddle'Thar (Two-Moons Dance): The cosmic order deity of the Khajiiti, the Riddle'Thar was revealed to Elsweyr by the prophet Rid-Thar-ri'Datta, the Mane. The Riddle'Thar is more a set of guidelines by which to live than a single entity, but some of his avatars like to appear as humble messengers of the gods. Also known as the Sugar God.<BR>
<BR>
Ruptga (Tall Papa): Chief deity of the Yokudan pantheon. Ruptga, more commonly 'Tall Papa', was the first god to figure out how to survive the Hunger of Satakal. Following his lead, the other gods learned the 'Walkabout', or a process by which they can persist beyond one lifetime. Tall Papa set the stars in the sky to show lesser spirits how to do this, too. When there were too many spirits to keep track of, though, Ruptga created a helper out the dead skin of past worlds. This helper is Sep (see below), who later creates the world of mortals.<BR>
<BR>
Satakal (The Worldskin): Yokudan god of everything. A fusion of the concepts of Anu and Padomay. Basically, Satakal is much like the Nordic Alduin, who destroys one world to begin the next. In Yokudan mythology, Satakal had done (and still does) this many times over, a cycle which prompted the birth of spirits that could survive the transition. These spirits ultimately become the Yokudan pantheon. Popular god of the Alik'r nomads.<BR>
<BR>
Sheogorath (The Mad God): The fearful obeisance of Sheogorath is widespread, and is found in most Tamrielic quarters. Contemporary sources indicate that his roots are in Aldmeri creation stories; therein, he is 'born' when Lorkhan's divine spark is removed. One crucial myth calls him the 'Sithis-shaped hole' of the world. <BR>
<BR>
Sheor (Bad Man): In Bretony, the Bad Man is the source of all strife. He seems to have started as the god of crop failure, but most modern theologians agree that he is a demonized version of the Nordic Shor, born during the dark years after the fall of Saarthal.<BR>
<BR>
Sep (The Snake): Yokudan version of Lorkhan. Sep is born when Tall Papa creates someone to help him regulate the spirit trade. Sep, though, is driven crazy by the hunger of Satakal, and he convinces some of the gods to help him make an easier alternative to the Walkabout. This, of course, is the world as we know it, and the spirits who followed Sep become trapped here, to live out their lives as mortals. Sep is punished by Tall Papa for his transgressions, but his hunger lives on as a void in the stars, a 'non-space' that tries to upset mortal entry into the Far Shores.<BR>
<BR>
Shezarr (God of Man): Cyrodilic version of Lorkhan, whose importance suffers when Akatosh comes to the fore of Imperial (really, Alessian) religion. Shezarr was the spirit behind all human undertaking, especially against Aldmeri aggression. He is sometimes associated with the founding of the first Cyrodilic battlemages. In the present age of racial tolerance, Shezarr is all but forgotten.<BR>
<BR>
Shor (God of the Underworld): Nordic version of Lorkhan, who takes sides with Men after the creation of the world. Foreign gods (i.e., Elven ones) conspire against him and bring about his defeat, dooming him to the underworld. Atmoran myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior king who leads the Nords to victory over their Aldmeri oppressors time and again. Before his doom, Shor was the chief of the gods. Sometimes also called Children's God (see Orkey, above).<BR>
<BR>
Sotha Sil (Mystery of Morrowind): God of the Dunmer, Sotha Sil is the least known of the divine Tribunal. He is said to be reshaping the world from his hidden, clockwork city.<BR>
<BR>
Stendarr (God of Mercy): God of the Nine Divines, Stendarr has evolved from his Nordic origins into a deity of compassion or, sometimes, righteous rule. He is said to have accompanied Tiber Septim in his later years. In early Altmeri legends, Stendarr is the apologist of Men.<BR>
<BR>
Stuhn (God of Ransom): Nordic precursor to Stendarr, brother of Tsun. Shield-thane of Shor, Stuhn was a warrior god that fought against the Aldmeri pantheon. He showed Men how to take, and the benefits of taking, prisoners of war.<BR>
<BR>
Syrabane (Warlock's God): An Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided Bendu Olo in the Fall of the Sload. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many from the scourge of the Thrassian Plague. He is also called the Apprentices' God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the Mages Guild.<BR>
<BR>
Tava (Bird God): Yokudan spirit of the air. Tava is most famous for leading the Yokudans to the isle of Herne after the destruction of their homeland. She has since become assimilated into the mythology of Kynareth. She is still very popular in Hammerfell among sailors, and her shrines can be found in most port cities.<BR>
<BR>
Tiber Septim (Talos, the Dragonborn): Heir to the Seat of Sundered Kings, Tiber Septim is the most important hero-god of Mankind. He conquered all of Tamriel and ushered in the Third Era (and the Third Empire). Also called Ysmir, 'Dragon of the North'.<BR>
<BR>
Trinimac: Strong god of the early Aldmer, in some places more popular than Auri-El. He was a warrior spirit of the original Elven tribes that led armies against the Men. Boethiah is said to have assumed his shape (in some stories, he even eats Trinimac) so that he could convince a throng of Aldmer to listen to him, which led to their eventual Chimeri conversion. He vanishes from the mythic stage after this, to return as the dread Malacath (Altmeri propaganda portrays this as the dangers of Dunmeri influence).<BR>
<BR>
Tsun: Extinct Nordic god of trials against adversity. Died defending Shor from foreign gods.<BR>
<BR>
Tu'whacca (Tricky God): Yokudan god of souls. Tu'whacca, before the creation of the world, was the god of Nobody Really Cares. When Tall Papa undertook the creation of the Walkabout, Tu'whacca found a purpose; he became the caretaker of the Far Shores, and continues to help Redguards find their way into the afterlife. His cult is sometimes associated with Arkay in the more cosmopolitan regions of Hammerfell.<BR>
<BR>
Vivec (Master of Morrowind): Warrior-poet god of the Dunmer. Vivec is the invisible keeper of the holy land, ever vigilant against the dark gods of the Volcano. He/she has saved the Dunmeri people from certain death on numerous occasions, most notably when he/she taught them how to breathe water for a day so that he/she could flood Morrowind and kill the Akaviri invaders, ca. 2E572.<BR>
<BR>
Xarxes: Xarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to Auri-El, and has kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments, large and small, since the beginning of time. He created his wife, Oghma, from his favorite moments in history.<BR>
Y'ffre (God of the Forest): Most important deity of the Bosmeri pantheon. While Auri-El Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, the Bosmer revere Y'ffre as the spirit of 'the now'. According to the Wood Elves, after the creation of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into the first of the Ehlnofey, or 'Earth Bones'. After these laws of nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, because they could finally understand it. Y'ffre is sometimes called the Storyteller, for the lessons he taught the first Bosmer. Some Bosmer still possess the knowledge of the chaos times, which they can use to great effect (the Wild Hunt). <BR>
<BR>
Ysmir (Dragon of the North): The Nordic aspect of Talos. He withstood the power of the Greybeards' voices long enough to hear their prophecy. Later, many Nords could not look on him without seeing a dragon.<BR>
<BR>
Z'en (God of Toil): Bosmeri god of payment in kind. Studies indicate origins in both Argonian and Akaviri mythologies, perhaps introduced into Valenwood by Kothringi sailors. Ostensibly an agriculture deity, Z'en sometimes proves to be an entity of a much higher cosmic order. His worship died out shortly after the Knhaten Flu.<BR>
<BR>
Zeht (God of Farms): Yokudan god of agriculture. Renounced his father after the world was created, which is why Tall Papa makes it so hard to grow food.<BR>
<BR>
Zenithar (God of Work and Commerce, Trader God): Member of the Nine Divines, Zenithar is understandably associated with Z'en. In the Empire, however, he is a far more cultivated god of merchants and middle nobility. His worshippers say, despite his mysterious origins, Zenithar is the god 'that will always win'.<BR>

Galerion The Mystic<BR>
By Asgrim Kolsgreg<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
During the early bloody years of the Second Era, Vanus Galerion was born under the name Trechtus, a serf on the estate of a minor nobleman, Lord Gyrnasse of Sollicich-on-Ker. Trechtus' father and mother were common laborers, but his father had secretly, against the law of Lord Gyrnasse, taught himself and then Trechtus to read. Lord Gyrnasse had been advised that literate serfs were an abomination of nature and dangerous to themselves and their lords, and had closed all bookstalls within Sollicich-on-Ker. All booksellers, poets, and teachers were forbidden, except within Gyrnasse's keep. Nevertheless, a small scale smuggling operation kept a number of books and scrolls in circulation right under Gyrnasse's shadow.<BR>
<BR>
When Trechtus was eight, the smugglers were found and imprisoned. Some said that Trechtus's mother, an ignorant and religious woman fearful of her husband, was the betrayer of the smugglers, but there were other rumors as well. The trial of the smugglers was nonexistant, and the punishment swift. The body of Trechtus' father was kept hanging for weeks during the hottest summer Sollicich-on-Ker had seen in centuries.<BR>
<BR>
Three months later, Trechtus ran away from Lord Gyrnasse's estate. He made it as far as Alinor, half-way across Summerset Isle. A band of troubadours found him nearly dead, curled up in a ditch by the side of the road. They nursed him to health and employed him as an errand boy in return for food and shelter. One of the troubadours, a soothsayer named Heliand, began testing Trechtus' mind and found the boy, though shy, to be preternaturally intelligent and sophisticated given his circumstances. Heliand recognized in the boy a commonality, for Heliand had been trained on the Isle of Artaeum as a mystic.<BR>
<BR>
When the troupe was performing in the village of Potansa on the far eastern end of Summurset, Heliand took Trechtus, then a boy of eleven, to the Isle of Artaeum. The Magister of the Isle, Iachesis, recognized potential in Trechtus and took him on as pupil, giving him the name of Vanus Galerion. Vanus trained his mind on the Isle of Artaeum, as well as his body.<BR>
<BR>
Thus was the first Archmagister of the Mages Guild trained. From the Psijics of the Isle of Artaeum, he received his training. From his childhood of want and injustice, he received his philosophy of sharing knowledge.<BR>

Mixed Unit Tactics in the Five Years War<BR>
Volume One<BR>
By Codus Callonus<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
The Legions could learn from the unconventional tactics used by the Khajiit in the Five Years War against Valenwood. I was stationed at the Sphinxmoth Legion Fort on the border near Dune and witnessed many of the northern skirmishes firsthand.<BR>
<BR>
The war started with the so-called ""Slaughter of Torval."" The Khajiit claim that the Bosmer invaded the city without provocation and killed over a thousand citizens before being driven off by reinforcements from a nearby jungle tribe. The Bosmer claim that the attack was in retaliation for Khajiiti bandits who were attacking wood caravans headed for Valenwood.<BR>
<BR>
In the spring of 3E 396 the war moved closer to Fort Sphinxmoth. I was posted on lookout and saw parts of the conflict. I later spoke with both Khajiit and Bosmer who fought in the battle, and it will serve as an excellent example of how the Khajiit used a mixture of ground and tree units to win the war.<BR>
<BR>
The Khajiit began the fight in an unusual way by sending tree-cutting teams of Cathay-raht and the fearsome Senche-raht or ""Battlecats"" into the outskirts of Valenwood's forests. When word reached the Bosmer that trees were being felled (allegedly a crime in the strange Bosmeri religion), a unit of archers were dispatched from larger conflicts in the south. The Bosmer were thus goaded into splitting their forces into smaller groups.<BR>
<BR>
The Bosmer archers took up positions in the remaining trees whose branches were now twenty or more feet apart, allowing some light into the forest floor. The Bosmer bent the remaining trees with their magics into small fortifications from which to fire their bows.<BR>
<BR>
When the tree-cutters arrived the next morning, a half dozen Khajiit fell to the Bosmer arrows in the first volley. After that the Khajiit took large wooden shields from the backs of the Senche-raht and made a crude shelter. The Khajiit, even the enormous Senche-raht, were able to hide between this shelter and one of the larger trees. When it became apparent that the Khajiit would not leave their shelter, some Bosmer choose to descend and engage the Khajiit sword-to-claw.<BR>
<BR>
When the Bosmer were nearly upon the shelter, one of the Khajiit began playing on a native instrument of plucked metal bars. This was a signal of some kind, and a small group of the man-like Ohmes and Ohmes-raht emerged from covered holes on the forest floor. Although outnumbered, they were attacking from behind by surprise and won the ground quickly.<BR>
<BR>
The Bosmer archers in the trees would have still won the battle were they not having troubles of their own. A group of Dagi and Dagi-raht, two of the less common forms of Khajiit who live in the trees of the Tenmar forest, jumped from one tree to another under a magical cover of silence. They took up positions in the higher branches that could not hold a Bosmer's weight. When the signal came, they used their claws and either torches or spells of fire (accounts from the two survivors I spoke with vary on this point) to distract the archers while the battle on the ground took place. A few of the archers were able to flee, but most were killed.<BR>
<BR>
Apparently the Dagi and Dagi-raht have more magical ability than is widely believed if they were able to keep themselves magically silenced for so long. One of the surviving Bosmer told me that he saw a few ordinary cats among the Dagi and even claimed that these ordinary cats are known as 'Alfiq' and that they were the spellcasters, but Bosmer are almost as unreliable as the Khajiit when it comes to the truth, and I cannot believe that a housecat can cast spells.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of the day the Khajiit lost perhaps a half-dozen fighters out a force of no more than four dozen, while the Bosmer lost nearly an entire company of archers. The survivors were unable to report back before a second company of archers arrived and this strategy was repeated again, with similar results. Finally, a much larger force was sent and the Bosmer won that battle with the help of the native animals of Valenwood. That third skirmish and the Khajiiti response I will discuss in the second volume of this series.<BR>

<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
The Underking, Ysmir Kingmaker<BR>
<BR>
With his god destroyed, Wulfharth finds it hard to keep his form. He staggers out of Red Mountain to the battlefield beyond. The world has shaken and all of Morrowind is made of fire. A strong gale picks up, and blows his ashes back to Skyrim.<BR>
<BR>
Wulfharth adopts and is adopted by the Nords then. Ysmir the Grey Wind, the Storm of Kyne. But through Lorkhan he lost his national identity. All he wants the Nords for is to kill the Tribunal. He raises a storm, sends in his people, and is driven back by Tribunal forces. The Dunmer are too strong now. Wulfharth goes underground to wait and strengthen and reform his body anew. Oddly enough, it is Almalexia who disturbs his rest, summoning the Underking to fight alongside the Tribunal against Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal, the Akaviri demon. Wulfharth disappears after Ada'Soom is defeated, and does not return for three hundred years.<BR>
<BR>
It is the rumbling of the Greybeards that wake him. Though the Empire has crumbled, there are rumors that a chosen one will come to restore it. This new Emperor will defeat the Elves and rule a united Tamriel. Naturally, Wulfharth thinks he is the figure of prophecy. He goes directly to High Hrothgar to hear the Greybeards speak. When they do, Ysmir is blasted to ash again. He is not the chosen one. It is a warrior youth from High Rock. As the Grey Wind goes to find this boy, he hears the Greybeards' warning: remember the color of betrayal, King Wulfharth.<BR>
<BR>
The Western Reach was at war. Cuhlecain, the King of Falkreath in West Cyrodiil, was in a bad situation. To make any bid at unifying the Colovian Estates, he needed to secure his northern border, where the Nords and Reachmen had been fighting for centuries. He allies with Skyrim at the Battle of Old Hrol'dan. Leading his forces was Hjalti Early-Beard. Hjalti was from the island kingdom of Alcaire, in High Rock, and would become Tiber Septim, the First Emperor of Tamriel.<BR>
<BR>
Hjalti was a shrewd tactician, and his small band of Colovian troops and Nord berserkers broke the Reachman line, forcing them back beyond the gates of Old Hrol'dan. A siege seemed impossible, as Hjalti could expect no reinforcements from Falkreath. That night a storm came and visited Hjalti's camp. It spoke with him in his tent. At dawn, Hjalti went up to the gates, and the storm followed just above his head. Arrows could not penetrate the winds around him. He shouted down the walls of Old Hrol'dan, and his men poured in. After their victory, the Nords called Hjalti Talos, or Stormcrown.<BR>
 <BR>
Cuhlecain, with his new invincible general, unifies West Cyrodiil in under a year. No one can stand before Hjalti's storms. The Underking knows that if Hjalti is to become Emperor of Tamriel, he must first capture the Eastern Heartland. Hjalti uses them both. He needs Cuhlecain in the Colovian Estates, where foreigners are mistrusted. It is obvious why he needs Ysmir. They march on the East, the battlemages surrender before their armies, and they take the Citadel. Before Cuhlecain can be crowned, Hjalti secretly murders him and his loyalist contingent. These assassinations are blamed on the enemies of Cuhlecain, which, for political reasons, are still the Western Reach. Zurin Arctus, the Grand Battlemage (not the Underking), then crowns Hjalti as Tiber Septim, new Emperor of All Cyrodiil. After he captures the Imperil Throne, Septim finds the initial administration of a fully united Cyrodiil a time-consuming task. He sends the Underking to deal with Imperial expansion into Skyrim and High Rock. Ysmir, mindful that it might seem as if Tiber Septim is in two places at once, works behind the scenes. This period of levelheaded statesmanship and diplomacy, this sudden silence, heretofore unknown in the roaring tales of Talosian conquest, are explained away later. (The assassination story is embroidered -- now it is popularly Talos' own throat that was cut.)<BR>
<BR>
The human kingdoms are conquered, even Hammerfell, whose capture was figured to be an arduous task. The Underking wants a complete invasion, a chance to battle their foreign wind spirits himself, but Tiber Septim refutes him. He has already made a better plan, one that will seem to legitimize his rule. Cyrodiil supports the losing side of a civil war and are invited in. Finally, the Empire can turn its eyes onto the Elves.<BR>
<BR>
The Underking continues to press on Tiber Septim the need to conquer Morrowind. The Emperor is not sure that it is a wise idea. He has heard of the Tribunal's power. The Underking wants his vengeance, and reminds Tiber Septim that he is fated to conquer the Elves, even the Tribunal. Arctus advises against the move but Septim covets the Ebony in Morrowind, as he sorely needs a source of capital to rebuild Cyrodiil after 400 years of war. The Underking tells him that, with the Tribunal dead, Septim might steal the Tribunal's power and use it against the High Elves (certainly the oldest enemies of Lorkhan, predating even the Tribunal). Summerset Isle is the farthest thing from Tiber Septim's mind. Even then, he was planning to send Zurin Arctus to the King of Alinor to make peace. The Ebony need wins out in the end. The Empire invades Morrowind, and the Tribunal give up. When certain conditions of the Armistice include not only a policy of noninterference with the Tribunal, but also, in the Underking's eyes, a validation of their religious beliefs, Ysmir is furious. He abandons the Empire completely. This was the betrayal the Greybeards spoke of. Or so he thinks.<BR>
<BR>
Without the Underking's power, all ideas of conquering Tamriel vanish. Would've been nice, Septim thinks, but let's just worry about Cyrodiil and the human nations. Already there is a rebellion in Hammerfell. <BR>
<BR>
Pieces of Numidium trickle in, though. Tiber Septim, always fascinated by the Dwarves, has Zurin Arctus research this grand artifact. In doing so, Arctus stumbles upon some of the stories of the war at Red Mountain. He discovers the reason the Numidium was made and some of its potential. Most importantly, he learns the Underking's place in the War. But Zurin Arctus was working from incomplete plans. He thinks it is the heart of Lorkhan's body that is needed to power the Numidium.<BR>
<BR>
While Zurin Arctus is raving about his discovery, the prophecy finally becomes clear to Tiber Septim. This Numidium is what he needs to conquer the world. It is his destiny to have it. He contacts the Underking and says he was right all along. They should kill the Tribunal, and they need to get together and make a plan. While the Underking was away he realized the true danger of Dagoth-Ur. Something must to be done. But he needs an army, and his old one is available again. The trap is set.<BR>
<BR>
The Underking arrives and is ambushed by Imperial guards. As he takes them on, Zurin Arctus uses a soulgem on him. With his last breath, the Underking's Heart roars a hole through the Battlemage's chest. In the end, everyone is dead, the Underking has reverted back to ash, and Tiber Septim strolls in to take the soulgem. When the Elder Council arrives, he tells them about the second attempt on his life, this time by his trusted battle mage, Zurin Arctus, who was attempting a coup. He has the dead guards celebrated as heroes, even the one who was blasted to ash... He warns Cyrodiil about the dangers within, but says he has a solution to the dangers without. The Mantella.<BR>
 <BR>
The Numidium, while not the god Tiber Septim and the Dwemer hoped for (the Underking was not exactly Lorkhan, after all), it does the job. After its work on Summerset Isle a new threat appears -- a rotting undead wizard who controls the skies. He blows the Numidium apart. But it pounds him into the ground with its last flailings, leaving only a black splotch. The Mantella falls into the sea, seemingly forever.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, Tiber Septim crowns himself the First Emperor of Tamriel. He lives until he is 108, the richest man in history. All aspects of his early reign are rewritten. Still, there are conflicting reports of what really happened, and this is why there is such confusion over such questions as: Why does Alcaire claim to be the birthplace of Talos, while other sources say he came from Atmora? Why does Tiber Septim seem to be a different person after his first roaring conquests? Why does Tiber Septim betray his battlemage? Is the Mantella the heart of the battlemage or is it the heart of Tiber Septim?<BR>
 <BR>
Tiber Septim is succeeded by his grandson, Pelagius I. Pelagius is just not of the same caliber. In truth, he's a little nervous with all these provinces. Then an advisor shows up. <BR>
<BR>
$93I was friends with your grandfather,$94 the Underking says, $93He sent me to help you run the Empire.""<BR>

House Dagoth is an extinct Great House. In the wake of the ancient Battle of Red Mountain, its leadership was revealed to have plotted treason, and was discredited. Many of House Dagoth died defending the House; those survivors who were faithful to the Great Council were redistributed among the other houses. The Temple says the ancient, legendary evil beings that dwell beneath Red Mountain in the Dagoth Ur region are the original leaders of this extinct house, sustained by some powerful, evil sorceries.<BR>

[The following are notes from Sharn gra-Muzgob to Caius Cosades.]<BR>
<BR>
The Nerevarine Cult<BR>
<BR>
This Ashlander religious cult follows prophecies of a Nerevar reborn to honor ancient promises to the tribes, to reestablish the traditions of the Prophet Veloth, to cast down the false gods of the Tribunal Temple, and to drive all outlanders from Morrowind. Both Temple and Empire outlaw the cult, but it persists among the Ashlanders, despite Imperial and Temple repression. Because it is persecuted, it remains a secret cult, and it is hard to judge how widespread it is among the Ashlanders, or whether it has any following outside the Ashlander tribes.<BR>
<BR>
The Nerevarine<BR>
<BR>
The Ashlanders firmly believe that Nerevar will return to restore the glories of ancient Resdayn. [Morrowind was called 'Resdayn' before the Imperial Occupation.] The Ashlanders say the Great Houses and the Temple have abandoned the pure teachings of the Prophet Veloth, forsaking ancestor worship for the false gods of the Tribunal, and embracing the comforts of civilization that corrupted the High Elves. The Temple, on the other hand, venerates Saint Nerevar, but rejects the disgusting notion that the False Incarnate will walk the earth like a ghoul.<BR>
<BR>
Nerevar<BR>
<BR>
The Temple honors Saint Nerevar as the greatest Dunmer general, First Councilor, and companion of Vivec, Almalexia, and Sotha Sil, who united the Dunmer Houses to destroy the evil Dwemer, the treacherous House Dagoth, and their Western allies at Red Mountain. But the Ashlanders say Nerevar promised to honor the Ancient Spirits and the Tribal law, and that he will come again to honor that promise. To the Ashlanders, this means destroying the false Temple and driving the Imperial invaders from the land.<BR>
<BR>
Nerevarine Prophecies<BR>
<BR>
Dream visions and prophecies are a respected tradition in Ashlander culture. Their wise women and shamans take careful note of dreams and visions, and pass on the tribe's legacies of vision and prophecy to their successors. By contrast, the Temple and the Western faiths are suspicious of mysticism, and they regard interpretation of dreams and visions as primitive superstition.<BR>
<BR>
The most common version of the Nerevarine Prophecy is THE STRANGER. The verses are obscure, as are most prophecies. But two observations are in order. <BR>
<BR>
First, many less-well-informed scholars assume that the phrase ""journeyed far 'neath moon and star"" is just a cliche to suggest a very long journey, but the Nerevar of legend was known to possess a magical ring named ""One-Clan-Under-Moon-and-Star,"" upon which Nerevar is supposed to have sworn his promise to honor ancient Ashlander traditions and land rights.<BR>
<BR>
Second, the reference to ""seven curses"" must certainly refer to the lost prophetic verses known to the Ashlanders as the SEVEN CURSES.<BR>
<BR>
THE STRANGER<BR>
<BR>
When earth is sundered, and skies choked black,<BR>
And sleepers serve the seven curses,<BR>
To the hearth there comes a stranger,<BR>
Journeyed far 'neath moon and star.<BR>
<BR>
Though stark-born to sire uncertain<BR>
His aspect marks his certain fate.<BR>
Wicked stalk him, righteous curse him.<BR>
Prophets speak, but all deny.<BR>
<BR>
Many trials make manifest<BR>
The stranger's fate, the curses' bane.<BR>
Many touchstones try the stranger<BR>
Many fall, but one remains.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lost Prophecies<BR>
<BR>
Ashlander elders complain of prophecies which have been lost to tribal memory due to the carelessness or ineptitude of earlier generations of wise women and ashkhans. Suspicious scholars wonder whether these prophecies might have been deliberately forgotten or suppressed. Three Nerevarine prophecies in particular are said to have been lost: 1. The Lost Prophecies; 2. The Seven Curses; and 3. Seven Visions of Seven Trials of the Incarnate. Perhaps these lost prophecies will someday be found, either in forgotten accounts written by literate travelers, or in the memories of isolated Ashlanders, or in the secret traditions of the wise women and shamans.<BR>

<BR>
Another common potion is that of restore fatigue. This can be made from scrib jelly and scuttle. Using hound meat instead of jelly may make a stronger potion, but the hound meat often spoils and makes the potion effective but undrinkable. Customers often prefer potions that taste better to ones that are only slightly more effective.<BR>

A potion to cure common diseases is another frequent request. These are quite simple to make here in Vvardenfell and often cheaper as grave dust is far more plentiful (and better preserved) by these fastidious Dunmer. Mix equal parts gravedust and green lichens. Heat over a low flame until the mixture turns brown.<BR>
<BR>
Notes: Daedra skin is just as effective, but very expensive. Chokeweed can be used in an emergency.<BR>
<BR>
Research notes on curing blight diseases:<BR>
<BR>
So far the only mixtures I've found to be even partially effective is scrib jelly and ash salts. These ingredients are not too hard to find, but the ratio needs some adjustment and the potion is not fully effective.<BR>

I am passing along orders from Therana that two crates of steel armor be delivered to the tower before nightfall. She doesn't care how or where you get them, just have them there as soon as you can. Therana is very irritable and prone to rashness lately with all the rumors of the impending siege by Trerayna, and I would strongly advise you not to become a source of further irritation by failing this duty. You will be compensated for your efforts of course.<BR>

Sorry I missed you. I had to run some old documents over to the Inquisitor at the Ministry of Truth, and I'm likely to be tied up there for a while. Why don't you meet me there as soon as you can? Then we can leave together as soon as I'm done. And Amaya, don't forget to bring me the two Divine Intervention scrolls you borrowed. Or, if you used them, buy a couple of new ones for me. I think I'm going to need them soon. Janand Maulinie at the Mages Guild in the Foreign Quarter keeps them in stock.<BR>

Nerevar at Red Mountain<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
[The following is from the Apographa, the hidden writings of the Tribunal Temple. It is a scholarly retelling of a tradition transmitted through the Ashlanders concerning the battle at Red Mountain and subsequent events. The Ashlanders associate this tale with the telling of Alandro Sul, a shield-companion of Nerevar who came to live among the Ashlanders after the death of Nerevar and during the ascension of the Tribunal. There are many variant treatments of this story, but the primary elements are consistent throughout the tradition. The murder of Nerevar, the tragic fate of Dagoth Ur, and the profane source of the Tribunal's divine power are denied by Temple doctrine as ignorant Ashlander superstition, and not widely known among civilized Dunmer.] <BR>
<BR>
Resdayn, present day Morrowind, was contested ground between two very different types of mer: the Chimer, who worshipped Daedra, and the Dwemer, who worshipped a profane and secret power. These two people warred with each other constantly until their lands were invaded by a young, vibrant, and violent alien culture, the Nords. <BR>
<BR>
Two heroes, one from the Chimer and one from the Dwemer, Indoril Nerevar and Dumac Dwarf-Orc, made peace between their people and together ousted the alien invaders. Then these two heroes worked long and hard to maintain that peace thereafter, though their counselors thought it could not last or, worse, that it shouldn't. Nerevar's queen and his generals-- Almalexia, Sotha Sil, Vivec-- told him to claim all Resdayn for his own. But Nerevar would not listen, for he remembered his friendship with Dumac. There would be only peace. <BR>
<BR>
Until Dagoth-Ur arrived. House Dagoth had discovered the source of the profane and secret power of the Dwemer: the legendary Heart of Lorkhan, which Dumac's people had used to make themselves immortal and beyond the measure of the gods. In fact, one of the their high priests, Kagrenac, was building a New God so that the Dwemer could claim Resdayn for their own. <BR>
<BR>
The Tribunal urged Nerevar again to make war on the Dwarves. Nerevar was troubled. He went to Dumac, his friend of old, and asked if what Dagoth-Ur said was true. But Kagrenac and the high priests of the Dwemer had kept their New God secret from their King, and Dumac said the Dwemer were innocent of any wrongdoing. Nerevar was troubled again and made pilgrimage to Holamayan, the sacred temple of Azura, who confirmed that all that Dagoth-Ur said was indeed true and that the New God of the Dwemer should be destroyed for the safety of not only Resdayn, but for the whole world. When Nerevar went back and told his Tribunal what the goddess had said, his queen and generals felt themselves proved aright and again counseled him to war. There were reasons that the Dwemer and Chimer had hated each other forever. <BR>
<BR>
Finally, Nerevar, angered that his friend Dumac would lie to him, went back to Vvardenfell. This time the Chimer King was arrayed in arms and armor and had his hosts around him, and he spoke harshly to Dumac Dwarf-Orc, King of Red Mountain. ""You must give up your worship of the Heart of Lorkhan or I shall forget our friendship and the deeds that were accomplished in its name!"" And Dumac, who still knew nothing of Kagrenac's New God, but proud and protective as ever of his people, said, ""We shall not relinquish that which has been our way for years beyond reckoning, just as the Chimer will not relinquish their ties to the Lords and Ladies of Oblivion. And to come at my door in this way, arrayed in arms and armor and with your hosts around you, tells me you have already forgotten our friendship. Stand down, my sweet Nerevar, or I swear by the fifteen-and-one golden tones I shall kill you and all your people."" <BR>
<BR>
And so the Chimer and Dwemer went to war. The Dwemer were well-defended by their fortress at Red Mountain, but the bravery and cleverness of Nerevar's queen and generals drew most of Dumac's armies out into the field and kept them there, so that Nerevar and Dagoth-Ur could make their way into the Heart Chamber by secret means. There, Nerevar met Dumac the Dwarf King, and they both fell from grievous wounds. Dagoth-Ur slew Kagrenac and took the tools the Dwemer used to tap the power of the Heart. He went to his dying lord Nerevar and asked him what to do with these tools. And Nerevar summoned Azura again, and she showed them how to use the tools to separate the power of the Heart from the Dwemer people. <BR>
<BR>
And on the fields, the Tribunal and their armies watched as the Dwemer turned into dust all around them as their stolen immortality was taken away. <BR>
<BR>
Back in Red Mountain, Nerevar told Dagoth-Ur to protect the tools and the Heart Chamber until he returned. Dagoth-Ur said, ""But shouldn't we destroy these tools at once, so that they might never be used for evil again?"" But Nerevar was confused by his wounds and his sorrow (for he still loved Dumac and the Dwemer people) and so went to the fields outside of Red Mountain to confer with his queen and his generals, who had foreseen that this war would come and whose counsel he would not ignore again. ""I will ask the Tribunal what we shall do with them, for they have had wisdom in the past that I had not. Stay here, loyal Dagoth-Ur, until I return."" <BR>
<BR>
Then Nerevar told his queen and generals all that had transpired under Red Mountain and how the Dwemer had used special tools to turn their people into immortals and of the wondrous power of the Heart of Lorkhan. The Tribunal decided that the Chimer should learn how to use this power so that Nerevar might claim Resdayn and the world for their people. Nerevar did not expect or want this, so he asked his queen and generals to help him summon Azura yet again for her guidance. But the Tribunal had become as greedy as Kagrenac upon hearing of the power of the Heart and they coveted it. They made ritual as if to summon Azura as Nerevar wanted but Almalexia used poisoned candles and Sotha Sil used poisoned robes and Vivec used poisoned invocations. Nerevar was murdered. <BR>
<BR>
Then Azura came forth anyway and cursed the Tribunal for their foul deeds. She told them that she would use her powers over dusk and dawn to make sure Nerevar would come back and make things right again. But the Tribunal laughed at her and said that soon they would be gods themselves and that the Chimer people would forget their old ways of worship. And Azura knew this would be true and that it would take a long time before her power might bring Nerevar back. ""What you have done here today is foul beyond measure and you will grow to regret it, for the lives of gods are not what mortals think and matters that weigh only years to mortals weigh on gods forever."" And so that they might know forever their wicked deeds Azura changed the Chimer into Dunmer, and their skin turned ashen and their eyes into fire. ""Let this mark remind you of your true selves who, like ghouls, fed on the nobility, heroism, and trust of their king."" <BR>
<BR>
And then the Tribunal went into Red Mountain and met with Dagoth-Ur. Dagoth-Ur saw what had been done, for his skin had changed as well, and he tried to avenge the death of Nerevar but to no avail. He was driven off and thought dead. The Tribunal found the tools he had been guarding and, through study of Kagrenac's methods, turned themselves into gods. <BR>
<BR>
Thousands of years after their apotheosis, the Tribunal are still the gods of Morrowind and the old ways of worship are remembered only by a few. And the murder of Nerevar is known to fewer. But his queen and generals still fear his return, for the words of Azura linger long and they see the mark of her curse on their people every day. <BR>

[a package sealed with an anonymous wax seal, containing a single-page, unsigned note]<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[on the cover of the package]<BR>
To the Outlander lately proclaiming his identity as the Nerevarine, to be delivered with haste --<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
[the note itself]<BR>
The assertions made being in direct contradiction of the doctrine of the Tribunal, namely, that you are the Nerevarine, the reincarnation of the Sainted Lord Nerevar, are, in addition to being against Temple teaching, incredible and implausible in the extreme.<BR>
<BR>
The revelations made by the Inquisition, namely, that you yourself are in fact an agent of the Imperial Intelligence Service, otherwise known as the Order of Blades, lately made with substantial evidence by the Lord High Archordinator, Berel Sala, further calls into question the validity of and motivations behind your claims.<BR>
<BR>
However, as incredible as your claims are, as much as they are in direct contradiction of the teachings of the Temple, and tainted as they are by the inferences to be made upon your close association with the covert policies and interests of the Emperor, the interests of the Temple and its leadership, and in particular, the interests of His Immortal Lordship, Vivec, are best served by a close and personal examinations of the claims being made, and close and personal examinations of the motivations and character of the claimant.<BR>
<BR>
The Temple, through its examinations of its records, in particular, the records of the Heirographa and Apographa, is intimately familiar with the many and varied claims of signs and feats that would mark the Nerevarine according to prophecy.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, in the event of the fulfillment of certain of those most remarkable and scarcely credible claims -- namely, that the claimant should, at one time, be the acknowledged holder of several ancient titles of power and authority of the Dunmer people, to whit, Hortator of the Great Houses and Nerevarine of the Ashlander tribes -- the Temple proposes that the claimant of the identity of the Nerevarine shall present himself for inspection before his Reverend Honor, Archcanon Lord Tholer Saryoni, High Archcanon and Chancellor of Vivec, Archcanon of the Canonry of Vvardenfell, Arch-Priest of the High Fane, for a review and consideration of his claims and identity. However, until such time as the claimant actually has been named Hortator separately and jointly by the three Great Houses of Vvardenfell, and at the same time has been named Nerevarine separately and jointly by the four tribes of the Ashlanders, there is no purpose in reviewing or discussing these claims.<BR>
<BR>
Because of the Temple's official position on the prophecies of the Nerevarine, and in the interests of preserving the security of the claimant from those parties who might wish to do him harm, it is convenient that the claimant of the title Nerevarine shall present himself in secret to Archcanon Saryoni in the archcanon's private quarters in the High Fane of Vivec. <BR>
<BR>
To signify agreement with these terms and conditions for a meeting with the archcanon, the Nerevarine claimant may present himself to the healer of the High Fane of Vivec, Danso Indules, and the necessary arrangements will be made. Once again, no purpose is served by a meeting until the claimant is named Hortator of the three Great Houses and is named Nerevarine of the four Ashlander tribes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
written at the request of and in the name of his Reverend Honor Tholer Saryoni, Archcanon and Chancellor of Vivec,<BR>

Dileno Lloran, priest of Vivec, assistant to the Archcanon<BR>

Ser Yngling,<BR>
<BR>
I must admit that I was surprised by your request for funds to repair the House Hlaalu Temple in Vivec. Before our meeting last week I knew only that you were an outlander and not a member of our Temple. Once again, I ask that you forgive an old man for heeding to false rumors. Now that I have met you, I am sure that your motives are pure, and you can restore the Temple to its former glory.<BR>
<BR>
House Hlaalu has neglected its Temple in Vivec for many years and it is in a state of disrepair. Given the difficulty of this restoration, I would be pleased to contribute 50,000 drakes to your efforts.<BR>

<IMG SRC=""RedMountain_377_253.tga"" WIDTH=""377"" HEIGHT=""253""><BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
Morrowind is the northeastmost province of the Tamrielic Empire, bounded on the north and east by the Sea of Ghosts, on the west by Skyrim, on the southwest by Cyrodiil (also known as the Imperial Province), and on the south by Black Marsh (also known as Argonia). Vvardenfell District encompasses Vvardefell Island, a great land mass dominated by the giant volcano Red Mountain and cut off from mainland Morrowind by the surrounding Inner Sea.<BR>
<BR>
Only recently open to settlement and trade, most of the island's population is confined to the relatively hospitable west and southwest coast, centered on the ancient city of Vivec and the old Great House district centers at Balmora, Ald'ruhn, and Sadrith Mora. The rest of the island is covered by hostile desert wastes, arid grasslands, and volcanic badlands, and thinly populated by the nomadic Ashlander tribes.<BR>
<BR>
Vvardenfell has nine basic geographic regions, each with their own distinctive plants and terrain features. Scholars have based their classifications on the different types of land described by the native Ashlanders, so the designations are recognized by most local traders, travelers, and adventurers. These geographic regions are called: the Ascadian Isles, the Ashlands, Azura's Coast, the Bitter Coast, the Grazelands, Molag Amur, Red Mountain, the West Gash, and Sheogorad.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""CENTER""><BR>
ASCADIAN ISLES<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR>
<BR>
The Ascadian Isles is a region of lush, green, well-watered southern lowlands where most of Vvardenfell's agriculture is found. The area includes Pelagiad, Suran, Vivec City, and Ald Sotha along with the inland lakes and waterways of the Ascadian Isles proper. The urban areas of Vivec and Ebonheart of the southern coast are densely populated; the inland Ascadian Isles are dotted with small farms and large plantations. The climate is temperate and comfortable, with moderate rainfall.<BR>
<BR>
Ebonheart is the seat of the Imperial government for Vvardenfell district, and a busy center of maritime trade. Castle Ebonheart is the home of Duke Vedam Dren, the district's ruler and Emperor's representative. Also located at Castle Ebonheart are the Vvardenfell District Council chambers and the Hawk Moth Legion garrison. The officers, docks, and warehouses of the East Empire Company are also found in Ebonheart.<BR>
<BR>
Vivec City is the largest settlement on Vvardenfell, and one of the largest cities in the East. Each of the great cantons is the size of a complete town. The High Fane and the palace of Vivec are visited by hundreds of tourists and pilgrims daily. Citizens flock to the Arena for entertainments and war games. Outlanders mostly confine themselves to the Foreign Canton, while natives live, work, and shop in the Great House compounds and residential cantons.<BR>
<BR>
Ald Sotha is a splendid Daedric ruin within sight of Vivec City. Though exotic and picturesque, it is a dangerous site, haunted by old magics, dark cultists, and their Daedric summonings, and not recommended for sightseers.<BR>
<BR>
Suran is an agricultural village in the northeastern corner of the fertile Ascadian Isles region. Two popular pilgrimage sites are nearby -- the Fields of Kummu and the Shrine of Molag Bal.<BR>
<BR>
Pelagiad is a newly chartered Imperial village between Balmora and Vivec City on the western edge of the Ascadian Isles region. The village is right outside the Imperial Legion garrison at Fort Pelagiad. The houses and shops are built in the Western Imperial style, and Pelagiad looks more like a village in the western Empire than a Morrowind settlement.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""CENTER""><BR>
THE ASHLANDS<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR>
<BR>
The Ashlands are the dry, inhospitable wastelands surrounding the lower slopes of Red Mountain. The Ashlands extend to the Sea of Ghosts in the north, and elsewhere form a wide margin between the blighted Red Mountain region and other geographic regions. The village of Maar Gan is the only sizable permanent Ashlands settlement; Ald'ruhn, the district seat of House Redoran, is on the margin of the region. Ashlanders hunt for game here, and their herds find sparse grazing. It rains rarely, and suffers frequent ash storms.<BR>
<BR>
Maar Gan is a small isolated village in a remote region north of Ald'ruhn. The Maar Gan shrine is an important Temple pilgrimage site.<BR>
<BR>
The Ashlander Urshilaku tribe has a permanent settlement at Urshilaku camp in the Ashlands region north of Maar Gan village.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""CENTER""><BR>
AZURA'S COAST<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR>
<BR>
The rugged coast and islands of northern and eastern Vvardenfell are called Azura's Coast. The region is rocky, infertile, and largely uninhabited, except for the outpost at Molag Mar, the Telvanni settlements at Sadrith Mora, the wizard towers at Tel Aruhn, Tel Mora, and Tel Branora, and Ahemmusa camp and the remote fishing villages of Ald Redaynia and Dagon Fel on the north coast. There are no roads; most travel is by boat. Despite the rocky terrain, a variety of plants thrive on the regular rainfall.<BR>
<BR>
Sadrith Mora is the district seat of House Telvanni, and home of the Telvanni Council, though only one Telvanni councilor actually lives in Sadrith Mora. Sadrith Mora is an island settlement, and accessible only by sea and teleportation. The town is large, with many services, but it is open only to Telvanni retainers; outsiders must confine themselves to the Gateway Inn.<BR>
<BR>
Tel Branora is the tower and seat of the eccentric Telvanni wizard named Mistress Therana. The tower and its tiny village are located on a rocky promontory at the southeasternmost tip of Azura's Coast.<BR>
<BR>
Tel Fyr is the Telvanni tower of Sorcerer-Lord Divayth Fyr. Beneath the tower is the Corprusarium, a refuge-prison where the deranged, distorted victims of the deadly corprus disease are housed and tended.<BR>
<BR>
Tel Aruhn is the Telvanni tower of Archmagister Gothren, Telvanni Sorcerer-Lord and head of the Telvanni Council. The associated settlement is a sizable village, and the site of the Festival Slave Market, the largest slave market on Vvardenfell.<BR>
<BR>
Tel Mora is the Telvanni tower of Mistress Dratha, an ancient wizard of the Telvanni Council. The small settlement includes a few craftsfolk and a tradehouse.<BR>
<BR>
Tel Vos is the tower of Telvanni wizard and council member Master Aryon. Tel Vos is a peculiar blend of Telvanni and Western architectural styles, and is close to Vos village.<BR>
<BR>
Bal Fell is the ""City of Stone,"" an ancient First Era ruin in the southeastern islands and promontories of Azura's Coast. The site has a nasty reputation, and several Telvanni wizards currently have competing camps of hirelings and adventurers exploring and looting there. Legend says that Bal Fell was built on the site of an ancient Daedric worship center.<BR>
<BR>
The Ashlander Ahemmusa tribe has a permanent settlement at Ahemmusa camp on a rocky promontory at the northeastern tip of the Vvardenfell mainland in the Azura's Coast region.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""CENTER""><BR>
THE BITTER COAST<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR>
<BR>
The western coast of Vvardenfell from Seyda Neen north to Gnaar Mok is called the Bitter Coast. The salt marshes and humid swamps of this region are uninhabited, with the only settlements found at the good harbors of Gnaar Mok, Hla Oad, and Seyda Neen. Also called the Smuggler's Coast, the region's secluded coves and islands provide refuge for criminal trade, and the frequent rain and fog hides small boats from Excise cutters.<BR>
<BR>
The piercing light of the Grand Pharos at the mouth of the harbor of the port village of Seyda Neen is a beacon to mariners throughout the Inner Sea. Most visitors from the Empire make landfall at the port of Seyda Neen, where they are processed by the Imperial Census and Excise Commission agents of the Coastguard station. The Coastguard cutters docked here control smuggling and piracy on the Inner Sea.<BR>
<BR>
Hla Oad is a tiny isolated fishing village on western Vvardenfell in the Bitter Coast region. A rough track along the River Odai connects Hla Oad with the town of Balmora.<BR>
<BR>
Gnaar Mok is a tiny island fishing village in the Bitter Coast region of western Vvardenfell.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""CENTER""><BR>
THE GRAZELANDS<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR>
<BR>
The regular rain and dark soils of the Grazelands produce the rich grazing for Ashlander herds that give the region its name. The region lies in the northeast of Vvardenfell, sandwiched between the Ashlands and Azura's Coast. Permanent settlements include Vos village and the towers of Tel Vos and Tel Fyr. The Ashlanders of Zainab camp move their herds across the plains in search of fresh grazing. There are no roads or tracks, but travel is easy across the open plains.<BR>
<BR>
The Ashlander Zainab tribe has a permanent settlement at Zainab camp, near the village of Vos in the Grazelands region.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""CENTER""><BR>
MOLAG AMUR<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR>
<BR>
Located inland in the southeast of Vvardenfell, Molag Amur is an uninhabited wasteland of rocky hills, steep-sided ravines, lava pools, and barren ash pavements. Pathfinding and travel is extremely difficult in this trackless wilderness, and is complicated by frequent ash storms. The Ashlanders of Erabenimsun camp hunt game here, but few others venture into this region. The worst part of Molag Amur, called the Great Scathes, is considered impassible even by the Ashlanders.<BR>
<BR>
The outpost at Molag Mar is a fortified stronghold on the southeastern edge of the desolate Molag Amur region. Pilgrims bound for the nearby pilgrimage sites at Mount Assarnibibi and Mount Kand take refuge at the outpost's hostels, comforted by the garrison of Redoran and Buoyant Armiger crusaders stationed at the stronghold.<BR>
<BR>
The Ashlander Erabenimsun tribe has a permanent settlement at Erabenimsun camp, an isolated hut settlement in the middle of the desolate Molag Amur region.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""CENTER""><BR>
RED MOUNTAIN<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR>
<BR>
The dominant feature of Vvardenfell, Red Mountain, is a vast volcano in the center of Vvardenfell. The outer slopes are steep and rugged, and the crater is deep and dotted with surface lava. The Ghostfence, a magical barrier which blocks travel as well as seals in the harmful, disease-laden weather called 'blight,' rings the volcano's outer slopes, and is broken only at Ghostgate. Within the Ghostfence, rain never falls and the sun never shines; the only weather is the red and deadly ash-blight.<BR>
<BR>
Ghostgate is the gate citadel of the Ghostfence Ordinator and Buoyant Armiger garrisons. Ghostgate sits astride the only gap through which the monstrous hosts of Dagoth Ur might emerge from Red Mountain to threaten the rest of Morrowind. The Ghostfence itself is a colossal magical artifact that completely encircles Red Mountain and prevents the Blight from spilling its corruption across the rest of Vvardenfell.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""CENTER""><BR>
WEST GASH<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR>
<BR>
The western highlands of Vvardefell are called the West Gash. The region extends from the Sea of Ghosts on the northwest coast to the inland town of Balmora, where the region is sandwiched between the Bitter Coast and the Ashlands. The trading village of Gnisis is north of Ald'ruhn, and the fishing villages of Ald Veloth and Khuul lie on the north coast. The town of Caldera lies near Balmora. The herds of the Ashlanders of Urshilaku camp graze on the sparse but hardy highland vegetation.<BR>
<BR>
Balmora is the district seat of House Hlaalu, and the largest settlement on Vvardenfell after Vivec City. Good roads lead north to Ald'ruhn and south to Caldera, Seyda Neen, and Vivec City. The Imperial Legion garrison of Fort Moonmoth lies south of Balmora.<BR>
<BR>
Caldera is a recently chartered Imperial town and mining corporation. The Caldera Mining Company has been granted an Imperial monopoly to remove raw ebony from the rich deposits here. Caldera has the appearance and flavor of a Western Imperial town.<BR>
<BR>
Ald'ruhn is the district seat of House Redoran, and a large settlement. The Redoran Council chambers are located inside the shell of an ancient extinct giant crab. Tracks lead north to Maar Gan and Gnisis villages and south to Balmora.<BR>
<BR>
Gnisis is a small mining and trade village astride the silt strider caravan route between the northwest West Gash and Ald'ruhn.<BR>
<BR>
Ald Velothi and Khuul are tiny fishing villages on the northern coast of the West Gash.<BR>
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""CENTER""><BR>
SHEOGORAD<BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR>
<BR>
The large island of Sheogorad lies north of Vvardenfell. This island and its associated lesser islands are a maritime wilderness extending north from Vvardenfell into the Sea of Ghosts. The region is largely hostile and uninhabited, with two small villages at Ald Redaynia and Dagon Fel. Only Dagon Fel is reached by ship services; all other island-to-island transport must be provided by the traveler.<BR>

<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
Vivec City is the largest settlement on Vvardenfell, and one of the largest cities in the East. Each of the great cantons is the size of a complete town. The High Fane and the palace of Vivec are visited by hundreds of tourists and pilgrims daily. Citizens flock to the Arena for public entertainments like mock battles and comic plays. Outlanders mostly confine themselves to the Foreign Canton, while natives live, work, and shop in the Great House compounds and residential cantons. But most of all, this is Lord Vivec's holy city. The Ministry of Truth, the Temple prison, hangs above the great temple of the High Fane, the Halls of Wisdom and Justice, and Lord Vivec's Palace.<BR>
<BR>
Vivec is a city made up of eight cantons, each a little town in itself. On a map, it looks like a cross, with the Foreign Quarter at the top, the Temple Compound, with Vivec's Palace, the High Fane, the Ministry of Truth, and the Hall of Wisdom and the Hall of Justice at the bottom, the Hlaalu Compound to the west, the Telvanni Compound on the east, and four cantons grouped together at the center of the cross -- Redoran Compound northwest, Arena northeast, St. Delyn's Canton southwest, and St. Olms Canton southeast.<BR>
<BR>
The Foreign Quarter<BR>
<BR>
The Foreign Quarter is the large three-tiered canton to the north. Originally, foreigners were not allowed to enter Vivec any further than the Foreign Quarter, but now outlanders can travel throughout Vivec at will. The Imperial Guilds each have guildhalls and complete services here, and an Imperial cult shrine serves the spiritual needs of the Imperial faithful. Various independent tradesmen, craftsmen, and trainers also rent space here. The Black Shalk Cornerclub rents beds to non-guild visitors.<BR>
<BR>
Temple Compound<BR>
<BR>
The High Fane is the largest Tribunal temple on Vvardenfell. Archcanon Saryoni presides over the temple, along with a large staff of priests, healers, and monks. Pilgrims travel from all over Morrowind to view the High Fane and the Ministry of Truth, and to offer prayer and thanks before the Palace of Vivec. The Ministry of Truth, a celestial body suspended by Vivec's mighty power over the Temple Compound, is the headquarters of the Temple Ordinators, and heretics are imprisoned and re-educated there. The Hall of Wisdom and Hall of Justice contain the executive, administrative, judicial, and martial operations of the Tribunal Temple. The Palace of Vivec is the abode of the god-hero Lord Vivec, the Warrior-Poet of the three deities who comprise Almsivi, the divine patrons of the Tribunal Temple. Only the most devout are admitted to the presence of Lord Vivec, and only at his initiation. Beneath the Palace of Vivec is the Puzzle Canal, a place of worship and testing for questing heroes hoping to receive Vivec's favor. Many choice treasures are guarded by Daedric servants in the Puzzle Canal's dark passages.<BR>
<BR>
Hlaalu Compound<BR>
<BR>
Hlaalu Compound is the westmost canton. The Hlaalu Councilor Crassius Curio has a splendid tier-top mansion here. The tiers below contain Hlaalu treasuries, records, holding cells, and various Great House services. There are two public houses: the Elven Nations and the No Name Club. A variety of craftsmen and tradesmen also have shops at Hlaalu Compound. Some House Hlaalu nobles and retainers prefer to maintain their residences in the less-formal St. Delyn and St. Olms cantons.<BR>
<BR>
Telvanni Compound<BR>
<BR>
Telvanni Compound is the eastmost canton. The mage-lord Mavon Drenim is the ranking Telvanni noble. The Telvanni rent the compound from the Temple, and have to make do with a Velothi tower instead of their preferred mushroom towers. The administrative center includes a treasury and a hall of records. Slaves are housed in the lowest tiers, along with cells full of monsters. There are many tradesmen, craftsmen, and trainers, and the Lizard's Head cornerclub provides lodgings for Telvanni kin and mercenaries.<BR>
<BR>
Redoran Compound<BR>
<BR>
Redoran Compound is the canton south of the Foreign Quarter, west of and next to the Arena. The Redoran administrative center there includes the Redoran Treasury, Hall of Records, and Holding Cells. On the lowest tier is a Redoran shrine and ancestral vaults. Two noble families, the Sarens and the Dralors, have top-tier manors. There are many tradesmen, craftsmen, and trainers, and the Flowers of Gold cornerclub provides lodgings for Redoran kin and retainers.<BR>
<BR>
Arena Compound<BR>
<BR>
The Arena Compound lies between the Redoran compound on the west and the Telvanni compound on the east. The Arena is the site of public entertainments and combat sports. The comfortable domed Arena has seating for hundreds of spectators; beneath the Arena are dressing and storage rooms for entertainers and training rooms and animal pens for the combat competitors.<BR>
<BR>
St. Delyn and St. Olms Residential Cantons<BR>
<BR>
St. Delyn Canton and St. Olms Canton are residence cantons for commoners and paupers. The Temple charges very reasonable rents for comfortable workshops, shops, and apartments, and most of Vvardenfell's crafts and light industry are housed in these cantons. The Abbey of St. Delyn the Wise is on the top tier of St. Delyn, and Hlaalu Councilor Yngling Half-Troll has a top-tier manor on St. Olms.<BR>
<BR>
Transportation<BR>
<BR>
Foot bridges connect with the mainland between the Ebonheart region and Hlaalu Compound, between the north bay region and the Foreign Quarter, and between the east bay region and Telvanni Compound. Good roads lead from the Hlaalu Compound bridge south to Ebonheart and north to Seyda Neen and points north. Good roads lead from the Foreign Quarter bridge west towards Seyda Neen, north towards Suran and the Ascadian Isles, and east towards Molag Mar. Roads from the Telvanni Compound bridge are useful mostly for travelers to Molag Mar. Silt strider service is available at the north end of the Foreign Quarter bridge, traveling from Vivec to Suran, Seyda Neen, Balmora, and Molag Mar. Ships from the docks at the Foreign Quarter travel to Ebonheart, Hla Oad, Molag Mar, and Tel Branora. Ships from nearby Ebonheart sail to Hla Oad, Sadrith Mora, Tel Branora, and the Foreign Quarter of Vivec. Low-fare gondolas shuttle passengers from canton to canton via Vivec's canals.<BR>

Balmora is the district seat of House Hlaalu, and the largest settlement on Vvardenfell after Vivec City. Balmora's four districts are High Town, the Commercial District, Labor Town, and Fort Moonmoth. High Town, on the hill to the west, has the Tribunal Temple, Hlaalu Council Hall, rich manors, better shops, and the Morag Tong guildhall. The Commercial District, just west of the river, is centered on the large plaza north of South Gate, with the strider port along the south wall, east of South Gate. The Fighters Guild and Mages Guild, and most of Balmora's shops and inns, are located along the streets of the Commercial District. Labor Town, east of the river, where the commoners and poor live, has several modest cornerclubs and a few merchants. Fort Moonmoth, a long walk southeast of town, houses the Legion garrison and the Imperial cult.<BR>
<BR>
Services<BR>
<BR>
House Hlaalu services are available at Hlaalu Council Manor in High Town. Temple faithful seek solace and services at the Balmora Temple in the southeast. Outlanders must travel outside the town walls, through South Gate and east along well-marked roads to Fort Moonmoth for Imperial Legion and the Imperial cult services. The guildhalls of the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild are on the street north from the plaza in the Commercial District. Morag Tong services are available at their guildhall in the extreme northwest of High Town. Better shops are in High Town on the hill, with numerous merchants in the Commercial District, west of the river, and a few traders in Labor Town, east of the river.<BR>
<BR>
Notable Figures<BR>
<BR>
None of the Hlaalu counselors live in Balmora. Nileno Dorvayn at the Council Hall is the ranking Hlaalu local. At the Fighters Guild, Eydis Fire-Eye is the steward. Ranis Athrys is the Mages Guild steward. Ethasi Rilvayn is the Morag Tong steward. Feldrelo Sadri is the ranking cleric of the Balmora Tribunal Temple. The colorful 'Sugar Lips' Habasi, a freelance facilitator of no fixed address, is often rumored to be the local boss of the Thieves Guild.<BR>
<BR>
Transportation<BR>
<BR>
A good road leads south to Pelagiad, Seyda Neen, Ebonheart, and Vivec. A rugged wilderness track leads southwest along the Odai River to the fishing village of Hla Oad. Improved roads head north to Caldera and Ald'ruhn. The silt strider port is on the west side of the river near South Gate. Silt strider service goes to Ald'ruhn, Suran, Ald'ruhn, and Seyda Neen. Guild guides at the Mages Guild can teleport you to Ald'ruhn, Vivec, Caldera, and Sadrith Mora for a fee. Hla Oad is southwest on the coast. An unimproved trail leads northeast up the ravines of Foyada Mamaea to Ghostgate; the path is easy to follow, but dangerous beasts threaten pilgrims who travel this route to Ghostgate shrine.<BR>

Principle Districts of Ald'ruhn<BR>
<BR>
Ald'ruhn is the district seat of House Redoran, and one of the largest settlements on Vvardenfell. The three principal districts are Ald'ruhn town, Ald'ruhn-under-Skar, and Buckmoth Fort.<BR>
<BR>
Ald'ruhn town is a large settlement in the Redoran village style, built of local materials, with organic curves and undecorated exteriors inspired by the landscape and by the shells of giant native insects. Most guildhalls, cornerclubs, and merchants are sited in the southwest corner of town, convenient to West Gate and the strider port, while the Temple is located on high ground to the east, and surrounded by a residential section.<BR>
<BR>
Ald'ruhn-under-Skar is the most distinctive architectural feature of Ald'ruhn -- a manor and council district sheltered beneath the shell of an ancient extinct giant crab. The large carapace encloses a central dome, from which radiate the entrances to the Redoran Council chambers, the manors of the Redoran councilors, and shops of a few upscale merchants.<BR>
<BR>
Buckmoth Fort is the Imperial legion garrison for the district. The strong walls and towers of this Western fortress lies a short distance to the south of Ald'ruhn town, through South Gate behind the Mages Guild.<BR>
<BR>
Services<BR>
<BR>
House Redoran services are in the Council House and Councilor's Manors of Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar. The Ald'ruhn Temple on the east side of town provides service for Temple worshipers. Buckmoth Fort offers services to the Imperial Legion and devotees of the Imperial cult, including an Imperial cult altar. The guildhalls of the Fighters Guild and Mages Guild are near the South Gate. Pricy but high-quality clothier, alchemist, and enchanter shops are under Skar as well. Commodities at reasonable prices, but with smaller selections, are available from the smith, clothier, trader, pawnbroker, and bookseller near the entrance to Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar. The Ald Skar Inn and the Council Club cornerclub are found to the west, near West Gate and the silt strider port. The Rat in the Pot cornerclub is in south Ald'ruhn, near the guildhalls.<BR>
<BR>
Notable figures<BR>
<BR>
All six Redoran councilors, Brara Morvayn, Hlaren Ramoran, Athyn Sarethi, Garisa Llethri, Miner Arobar, and Bolvyn Venim, have manor residences in Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar. Edwinna Elbert is the Mages Guild steward, and Percius Mercius has recently become the Fighters Guild steward. Old Methal Seran is an eminent Temple priest and scholar. Raesa Pullia is commandant of Buckmoth Fort, but Imsin the Dreamer is the chapter steward. The Redguard Hean is priest of the Imperial cult. Goren Andarysis the guild steward of the Morag Tong, whose guildhall is found in Ald'ruhn-Under-Skar.<BR>
<BR>
Travel and Transportation<BR>
<BR>
Roads lead northwest to Maar Gan and Gnisis villages and by a circuitous western route to Caldera, Balmora, and points south. The road to Balmora swings northwest to avoid the barren wastes, and curves around towards the west until it heads south again to Caldera. Between Ald'ruhn and Caldera are many sidepaths; watch for signposts, or you'll get lost. The silt strider port is along the western town wall, north of West Gate. Silt strider service goes from Ald'ruhn to Balmora, Gnisis, Khuul, or Maar Gan.. Guild guides at the Mages Guild teleport you to Balmora, Vivec, Caldera, and Sadrith Mora for a modest fee. Gnaar Mok is a LONG and exceptionally unpleasant walk west to the coast and then south; there are no trails or marked routes. Casual travelers ill-equipped for the attacks of wild beasts and brigands should keep to the roads and travel services.<BR>

Sadrith Mora is the district seat of House Telvanni, and home of the Telvanni Council, though only one Telvanni councilor actually lives in Sadrith Mora. Sadrith Mora is an island settlement, and accessible only by sea and teleportation. The town is large, with many craftsmen, traders, and trainers, but it is open only to Telvanni retainers; outsiders should confine themselves to the Gateway Inn, and to Wolverine Hall, the Imperial quarters of the Legion garrison and guilds. The docks are in a sheltered bay on the western side of the island, and a trail leads up from the docks to the Gateway Inn. Beyond the Gateway Inn is the Great Market, with numerous craftsmen and traders, and a small slave market. North of the Great Market is the Telvanni Council Hall, a large orb supported by giant mushroom stalks. To the east of the Great Market is Tel Naga, the towering wizard-tower residence of Telvanni Councilor Mage-Lord Master Neloth.<BR>
<BR>
Services<BR>
<BR>
Outlanders can find services for the Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, and Imperial cult at Wolverine Hall. Members of the Thieves Guild congregate at Dirty Muriel's Cornerclub. Telvanni Great House and Tribunal Temple services are all housed within the Council Hall; additional Telvanni services are available in the Great Market district and in Tel Naga. The Gateway merchant inn is the only establishment with public beds. Members of the Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, and Imperial cults look for hospitality at Wolverine Hall. Telvanni kin and retainers stay at the Gateway, at Wolverine Hall, at a local cornerclub, or at Tel Naga. The Great Market has many services and tradesmen, and many others are scattered through town. There are two cornerclubs: Dirty Muriel's, for outlanders, and Fara's Hole in the Wall for local Dunmer. Tel Naga is Master Neloth's wizard tower.<BR>
<BR>
Notable Figures<BR>
<BR>
If you're not Telvanni or Telvanni retainers, you'll want to know Angaredhel, Prefect of Hospitality at the Gateway merchant inn, and Ery, Gateway's publican. At Wolverine Hall, Hrundi the Nord is the Fighters Guild steward, Procyon Nigiliusis is Mages Guild steward, and Aunius Autrus is the Imperial cult priest. Big Helende, the Thieves Guild Boss, makes frequent appearances at Dirty Muriel's Cornerclub. Telvanni wizards and retainers visit the Council Hall to confer with the Telvanni Mouths (Telvanni Mouths are spokesmen for their councilor mage-lords) Felisa Ulessen, Galos Mathendis, Arara Uvulas, Mallam Ryon, Raven Omayn, and Dalyne Arvel, Telvanni Council clerk. Councilor Mage-Lord Master Neloth lives in Tel Naga, the wizard tower in the center of town.<BR>
<BR>
Transportation<BR>
<BR>
Sadrith Mora is an island; there's no road or bridge to the mainland. To visit the mainland, you must either be able to fly, swim, or water-walk, or you must rely on shipmasters at the docks or the guild guide at the Mages Guild. Gals Arethi at the docks offers ship passage to Ebonheart, Tel Branora, Tel Mora, or Dagon Fel. Iniel at the Wolverine Hall Mages Guild can teleport you to Ald'ruhn, Vivec, Caldera, and Balmora for a modest fee.<BR>

Spymaster Caius Cosades<BR>
Knight-Errant of the Imperial Order of Blades<BR>
Director of Imperial Intelligence in Vvardenfell District, Eastern Provinces<BR>
<BR>
I have the honor to acquaint you with his Majesty's wishes concerning %PCName, an individual of no rank or consequence.<BR>
<BR>
%PCName has been released from prison by his Majesty's authority and sent to you with this missive. %PCName is to be entered as a Novice in the Imperial Order of the Blades, and is to serve under your absolute authority as you shall see fit, except insofar as his Majesty's particular wishes are concerned.<BR>
<BR>
His Majesty's particular wishes are as follows.<BR>
<BR>
A local superstition holds that an orphan and outcast, a youth born on a certain day to uncertain parents, shall unite all the tribes of the Dunmer, drive out the invaders of Morrowind, and shall reestablish the ancient laws and customs of the Dark Elven nations. This orphan and outcast is called in legend the ""Nerevarine,"" and is supposed to be a reincarnation of the long-dead Dunmer General and First Councilor, Lord Indoril Nerevar.<BR>
<BR>
%PCName has the appearance of meeting the conditions of this local superstition. Therefore it is his Majesty's desire that %PCName shall, insofar as is possible, satisfy the conditions of this ancient prophecy, and shall become the Nerevarine.<BR>
<BR>
Though this prophecy is indeed only an ancient local superstition, his Majesty has taken counsel on this matter with his most expert informants and confidants, and his Majesty is persuaded that the prophecy is genuine and significant, either in its entirety, or in its several parts, and he earnestly demands you treat this matter with the utmost seriousness.<BR>
<BR>
Certain aspects of this ancient superstition are described at the end of this document, and further materials will be forthcoming by courier at the earliest occasion. It will, of course, be necessary that you acquaint yourself better with the details of this ancient superstition from your local sources. Since this matter intimately concerns %PCName, it is expected that you will employ %PCName to gather information on this subject. His Majesty has taken a great personal interest in the legends and prophecies of the Nerevarine, and eagerly awaits reports your reports.<BR>
<BR>
I have the honor to be, Sir, your most Humble and Obedient Servant,<BR>
<BR>
Glabrio Bellienus<BR>
Personal Secretary to the Emperor<BR>

Great Houses of Morrowind<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
In modern times Morrowind is ruled by five Great Houses: House Hlaalu, House Redoran, House Telvanni, House Indoril, and House Dres. Only three of these Houses have interests in Vvardenfell. The three Great Houses on Vvardenfell identify themselves by their traditional colors: red for Redoran, yellow for Hlaalu, and brown for Telvanni. Thus, members of House Hlaalu may be referred to collectively as Yellows.<BR>
<BR>
The Great Houses traditions derive from ancient Dunmer clan and tribes, but now function as political parties. Dunmer Great House membership is largely a matter of birth and marriage, but Imperial colonists may also become retainers of a Great House, or may be adopted into a Great House. Initially an outlander may gain status in a house as an oath-bonded hireling, pledging exclusive loyalty to a single house and forsaking ambitions with all other houses. Later, after faithful service and advancement in lower ranks, an outlander may seek adoption into a Great House. Adoption and advancement to higher ranks in a Great House requires that a Great House councilor stand as sponsor for the candidate's character and loyalty. Finding a councilor to sponsor an outlander often involves performing a great service for the prospective sponsor.<BR>
<BR>
House Redoran is one of the three Dunmer Great Houses with holdings on Vvardenfell. The Redoran prize the virtues of duty, gravity, and piety. Duty is to one's own honor, and to one's family and clan. Gravity is the essential seriousness of life. Life is hard, and events must be judged, endured, and reflected upon with due care and earnestness. Piety is respect for the gods, and the virtues they represent. A light, careless life is not worth living. Redoran settlements are designed in the Dunmer village style, built of local materials, with organic curves and undecorated exteriors inspired by the landscape and by the shells of giant native insects.  Redoran villages are typically centered on Temple compounds and their courtyards, with huts and tradehouses gathered around a central plaza, as in the West Gash village of Gnisis. Ald'ruhn, the Redoran district seat, is exceptional, with its distinctive feature being the colossal prehistoric bug shell that has been adapted as the house's council house.<BR>
<BR>
As a result of its close relationship with the Imperial administration, House Hlaalu has emerged as politically and economically dominant among the Great Houses of Vvardenfell and Morrowind. Hlaalu welcomes Imperial culture and law, Imperial Legions and bureaucracy, and Imperial freedom of trade and religion. Hlaalu still honors the old Dunmer ways -- the ancestors, the Temple, and the noble houses -- but has readily adapted to the rapid pace of change and progress in the Imperial provinces. Unlike the other Great Houses, which are largely hostile to non-Dunmer, House Hlaalu aspires to live in peace and harmony with the other races, and to share in the growth and prosperity of the Empire. Hlaalu public buildings -- tradehouses and craft guilds, manors and council halls -- are designed as simple multi-storied buildings roughly rectangular in plan, featuring arched entranceways and modest decorated exteriors. More modest one-story private dwellings follow the same plan, except with less decoration. Hlaalu plantation estates resemble Temple compounds, with walled precincts enclosing outbuildings for craftsmen and servants, dominated by a grand manor residence in place of a Temple shrine.<BR>
<BR>
The wizard-lords of House Telvanni have traditionally isolated themselves, pursuing wisdom and mastery in solitude. But certain ambitious wizards-lords, their retainers, and clients have entered whole-heartedly into the competition to control and exploit Vvardenfell's land and resources, building towers and bases all along the eastern coast. According to Telvanni principles, the powerful define the standards of virtue, and the Telvanni are unwilling to allow the ambitious Hlaalu to dominate Vvardenfell's untapped resources by default. Telvanni architecture is dominated by the wizards' tower, a fantastic organic form grown and sculpted from stems, caps, and root-like holdfasts of the giant native mushrooms. Telvanni villages are comprised of smaller mushroom pods hollowed out for craftsmen and commoners. Open-air markets often include the giant cages displaying the wares of the slave masters.<BR>
<BR>
House Indoril and House Dres are the two Great Houses without holdings or interest in Vvardenfell. Indoril District occupies the heartland of Morrowind, comprising the lands south of the Inner Sea and the eastern coast. The city of Almalexia is located in Indoril District, and the Indoril are orthodox and conservative supporters of the Temple and Temple authority. House Indoril is openly hostile to Imperial culture and religion, and preserves many traditional Dunmer customs and practices in defiance of Imperial law. Dres District is in the south of Morrowind, bordering the swamps and marshes of Black Marsh. House Dres is an agrarian agricultural society, and its large saltrice plantations rely completely on slave labor for their economic viability. Always firm Temple supporters, House Dres is hostile to Imperial law and culture, and in particular opposed to any attempts to limit the institution of slavery.<BR>

At last! After these many years of searching, I'm sure I've located the proper caverns. The Crystals are just as the stories describe; ""...wrapped in crystalline embrace, the silver pierced brow of the Traitors shall ward his sleep."" This must be the place! This must be Mordrin Hanin's tomb!<BR>
 <BR>
Badama and I have established quarters here. No one shall steal my discovery. To imagine what treasures are hidden within this stone. Those Guild fools! Mocking my studies. The Powers I shall unleash upon their miserable skins. Tomorrow we will summon workers to begin excavation.<BR>
<BR>
The Summoning was successful, although Badama lacks concentration. We nearly had a Storm Atronach, but her poor skills allowed it to escape. We shall make do with vermin. To think of the earth we could have riven with the Atronach. Now we are forced to watch the Scamps scrape the surface with picks and shovels. Hideous, miserable creatures.<BR>
<BR>
Otherworldly, vermin, bastards! Fodder for my cauldron! Scamps are the most untrue of servants. I should enlist the efforts of the Giant Rats of the wilderness and have greater success. Whining, thieving, lazy and treacherous...Scamps! One attempted to flee, stealing a number of potions in his flight. I made short work of him. Perhaps the others will think deeply before following his path. Unfortunately, I was unable to locate one of my best Potions of Rising Force.<BR>
<BR>
Success! I discovered the traces of worked stone, which when inspected closely were obviously of Daedric workmanship. After great effort and much moving of earth and stone, the remaining blockage fell away with a great splash into a pool of loathsome water. The foul and noisome air which escaped nearly choked me. The Scamps broke into a great frenzy, trying to hurl themselves through the opening, shrieking with either terror or joy. The creatures are clearly insane.<BR>
<BR>
I've been forced to erect a gate at the opening. The Scamps still attempt to escape into its maw. I've placed Badama as sentry to monitor the worthless creatures. Perhaps they'll tear her to pieces in her sleep. No, I still require her talents in the upcoming search.<BR>
<BR>
The baleful effects of this place are telling on me. I've only just managed to distill some potions to aid us in our endeavor. Soon though, we will enter the chambers and finally realize a life's ambition. Still, though we find the tomb, it may be for naught if we cannot locate the ""Key Guardian"". Sometimes I hear voices in my dreams calling on Mordins's name. Is it terror or adulation?<BR>

The Mystery of Princess Talara, Part III<BR>
By Mera Llykith<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
Gnorbooth was leaving his favorite pub in Camlorn, The Breaking Branch, when he heard someone calling his name.  His was not the sort of a name that could be mistaken for another.  He turned and saw Lord Eryl, the Royal Battlemage from the palace, emerge from the darkness of the alley.<BR>
<BR>
$93Milord,$94 said Gnorbooth with a pleasant smile.<BR>
<BR>
$93I'm surprised to see you out this evening, Gnorbooth,$94 grinned Lord Eryl with a most unpleasant smile. $93I have not seen you and your master very much since the millennial celebration, but I understand you've been very busy.  What I've been wondering is what you've been busy doing.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Protecting the Imperial interests in Camlorn is busy work, milord.  But I cannot imagine you would be interested in the minutiae of the ambassador's appointments.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93But I am,$94 said the battlemage. $93Especially as the ambassador has begun acting most mysteriously, most undiplomatically lately.  And I understand that he has taken one of the whores from the Flower Festival into his house.  I believe her name is Gyna?$94<BR>
<BR>
Gnorbooth shrugged: $93He's in love, I would imagine, milord.  It can make men act very strangely, as I'm sure you've heard before.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93She is a most comely wench,$94 laughed Lord Eryl. $93Have you noticed how much she resembles the late Princess Talara?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I have only been in Camlorn for fifteen years, milord.  I never saw her late majesty.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Now I could understand it if he had taken to writing poetry, but what man in love spends his days in the kitchens of the palace, talking to old servants?  That hardly sounds like molten passion to me, even based on my limited experience.$94 Lord Eryl rolled his eyes. $93And what is this business he has now in - oh, what is the name of that village?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Umbington?$94 replied Gnorbooth, and immediately wished he hadn't.  Lord Eryl was too canny an actor to reveal it, but Gnorbooth knew at the pit of his stomach that the battlemage did not even know Lord Strale had left the capitol.  He had to get away to let the ambassador know, but there was still a game to be carefully played. $93He's not leaving for there until tomorrow.  I believe it's just to put a stamp on some deed that needs the Imperial seal.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Is that all?  How tedious for the poor fellow.  I suppose I'll see him when he returns then,$94 Lord Eryl bowed. $93Thank you for being so informative.  Farewell.$94<BR>
<BR>
The moment the royal battlemage turned the corner, Gnorbooth leapt onto his horse.  He had drunk one or two ales too many, but he knew he must find his way to Umbington before Lord Eryl's agents did.  He galloped east out of the capitol, hoping there were signs along the road.<BR>
<BR>
Seated in a tavern that smelled of mildew and sour beer, Lord Strale marveled at how the Emperor's agent Lady Brisienna always found the most public of places for her most private of conferences.  It was harvest time in Umbington, and all of the field hands were drinking away their meager wages in the noisiest of fashions.  He was dressed appropriately for the venue, rough trousers and a simple peasant's vest, but he still felt conspicuous.  In comparison to his two female companions, he certainly was.  The woman to his right was used to frequenting the low places of Daggerfall as a common prostitute.  Lady Brisienna to his left was even more clearly in her element.<BR>
<BR>
$93By what name would you prefer I call you?$94 Lady Brisienna asked solicitously.<BR>
<BR>
$93I am used to the name Gyna, though that may have to change,$94 was her reply. $93Of course, it may not.  Gyna the Whore may be the name writ on my grave.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I will see to it that there is no attempt on your life like that the Flower Festival,$94 Lord Strale frowned. $93But without the Emperor's help, I won't be able to protect you forever.  The only permanent solution is to capture those who would do you harm and then to raise you to your proper station.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Do you believe my story?$94 Gyna turned to Lady Brisienna.<BR>
<BR>
$93I have been the Emperor's chief agent in High Rock for many years now, and I have heard few stranger tales.  If your friend the ambassador hadn't investigated and discovered what he has, I would have dismissed you outright as a madwoman,$94 Brisienna laughed, forcing a smile onto Gyna's face to match. $93But now, yes, I do believe you.  Perhaps that makes me the madwoman.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93Will you help us?$94 asked Lord Strale simply.<BR>
<BR>
$93It is a tricky business interfering in the affairs of the provincial kingdoms,$94 Lady Brisienna looked into the depths of her mug thoughtfully. $93Unless there is a threat to the Empire itself, we find it is best not to meddle.  What we have in your case is a very messy assassination that happened twenty years ago, and its aftermath.  If His Imperial Majesty involved itself in every bloody hiccup in the succession in each of his thousand vassal kingdoms, he would never accomplish anything for the greater good of Tamriel.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I understand,$94 murmured Gyna. $93When I remembered everything, who I was and what happened to me, I resolved to do nothing about it.  In fact, I was leaving Camlorn and going back home to Daggerfall when I saw Lord Strale again.  He was the one who began this quest to resolve this, not me.  And when he brought me back, I only wanted to see my cousin to tell her who I was, but he forbade me.$94<BR>
$93It would have been too dangerous,$94 growled Strale. $93We still don't know yet the depths of the conspiracy.  Perhaps we never will.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I'm sorry, I always find myself giving long explanations to short questions.  When Lord Strale asked if I would help, I should have begun by saying 'yes,'$94 Lady Brisienna laughed at the change in Lord Strale and Gyna's expressions. $93I will help you, of course.  But for this to turn out well, you must accomplish two things to the Emperor's satisfaction.  First, you must prove with absolute certainty who is the power behind this plot you've uncovered.  You must get someone to confess.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93And secondly,$94 said Lord Strale, nodding. $93We must prove that this is a matter worthy of His Imperial Majesty's consideration, and not merely a minor local concern.$94<BR>
<BR>
Lord Strale, Lady Brisienna, and the woman who called herself Gyna discussed how to accomplish their goals for a few hours more.  When it was agreed what had to be done, Lady Brisienna took her leave to find her ally Proseccus.  Strale and Gyna set off to the west, toward Camlorn.  It was not long after beginning their ride through the woods that they heard the sound of galloping hoof beats far up ahead.  Lord Strale unsheathed his sword and signaled for Gyna to position her horse behind him.<BR>
<BR>
At that moment, they were attacked on all sides.  It was an ambush. Eight men, armed with axes, had been lying in wait.<BR>
<BR>
Lord Strale quickly yanked Gyna from her horse, pulling her behind him.  He made a brief, deft motion with his hands.  A ring of flame materialized around them, and rushed outward, striking their assailants.  The men roared in pain and dropped to their knees.  Lord Strale jumped the horse over the closest one, and galloped at full speed westward.  <BR>
<BR>
$93I thought you were an ambassador not a mage!$94 laughed Gyna.<BR>
<BR>
$93I still believe there are times for diplomacy,$94 replied Lord Strale.<BR>
<BR>
The horse and rider they had heard before met them on the road.  It was Gnorbooth. $93Milord, it's the royal battlemage!  He found out you two were in Umbington!$94<BR>
<BR>
$93With considerable ease, I might add,$94 Lord Eryl's voice boomed out of the woods.  Gnorbooth, Gyna, and Lord Strale scanned the dark trees, but they showed nothing.  The battlemage's voice seemed to emanate from everywhere and nowhere.<BR>
<BR>
$93I'm sorry, milord,$94 groaned Gnorbooth. $93I tried to warn you as soon as I could.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93In your next life, perhaps you'll remember not to trust your plans to a drunkard!$94 laughed Lord Eryl.  He had them in his sight, and the spell was unleashed.<BR>
<BR>
Gnorbooth saw him first, by the light of the ball of fire that leapt from his fingertips.  Later, Lord Eryl was to wonder to himself what the fool had intended to do.  Perhaps he was rushing forward to pull Lord Strale out of the path.  Perhaps he was trying to flee the path of destruction, and had simply moved left when he should have moved right.  Perhaps, as unlikely as it seemed, he was willing to sacrifice himself to save his master.  Whatever the reason, the result was the same. <BR>
<BR>
He got in the way.<BR>
<BR>
There was an explosion of energy that filled the night, and an echoing boom that shook birds from the trees for a mile around. On the few square feet where Gnorbooth and his horse had stood was nothing but black glass.  They had been reduced to less than vapor.  Gyna and Lord Strale were thrown back.  Their horse, when it recovered its senses, galloped away as fast as it could.  In the lingering glowing aura of the spell's detonation, Lord Strale looked straight into the woods and into the wide eyes of the battlemage.  <BR>
<BR>
$93Damn,$94 said Lord Eryl and began to run.  The ambassador jumped to his feet and pursued.<BR>
<BR>
$93That was an expensive use of magicka, even for you,$94 said Lord Strale as he ran. $93Don't you know well enough not to use ranged spells unless you are certain your target won't be blocked?$94<BR>
<BR>
$93I never thought - that idiot -$93 Lord Eryl was struck from behind and knocked to the wet forest floor before he had a chance to finish his lamentation.<BR>
<BR>
$93It doesn't matter what you thought,$94 said Lord Strale calmly, flipping the battlemage around and pinning his arms to the ground with his knees. $93I'm not a battlemage, but I knew enough not to use my entire reserve on your little ambush.  Perhaps it's a matter of philosophy, as a government agent, I feel inclined toward conservatism.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What are you going to do?$94 whimpered Lord Eryl.<BR>
<BR>
$93Gnorbooth was a good man, one of the best, and so I'm going to hurt you quite a lot,$94 the ambassador made a slight movement and his hands began to glow brightly. $93That's a certainty.  How much more I'm going to hurt you after that depends on what you tell me.  I want to hear about the former Duke of Oloine.$94<BR>
<BR>
$93What do you want to know?$94 Lord Eryl screamed.<BR>
<BR>
$93Let's start with everything,$94 replied Lord Strale with perfect patience.<BR>

The Thirty-Six Lessons of Vivec: Sermon Sixteen<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
The Hortator wandered through the Mourning Hold, wrestling with the lessons he had learned. They were slippery in his mind. He could not always keep the words straight and knew that this was a danger. He wandered to find Vivec, his lord and master, the glory of the image of Veloth, and found him of all places in the Temple of False Thinking. There, clockwork shears were taking off Vivec's hair. A beggar king had brought his loom and was making of the hair an incomplete map of adulthood and death.<BR>
<BR>
Nerevar said, 'Why are you doing this, milord?'<BR>
<BR>
Vivec said, 'To make room for the fire.'<BR>
<BR>
And the Hortator could see that Vivec was out of sorts, though not because of the impending new power to come. The golden warrior-poet had been exercising his Water Face as well, learned from the dreughs before he was born.<BR>
<BR>
Nerevar said, 'Is this to keep you from the fire?'<BR>
<BR>
Vivec said, 'It is so that I may see with truth. It, and my place here at the altar of Padhome in the house of False Thinking, serve so that I may see beyond my own secrets. The Water Face cannot lie. It comes from the ocean, which is too busy to think, much less lie. Moving water resembles truth by its trembling.'<BR>
<BR>
Nerevar said, 'I am afraid to become slipshod in my thinking.'<BR>
<BR>
Vivec said, 'Reach heaven by violence then.'<BR>
<BR>
So to quiet his mind the Hortator chose from the Fight Racks an axe. He named it and moved on to the first moon.<BR>
<BR>
There, Nerevar was greeted by the Parliament of Craters, who knew him by title and resented his presence, for he was to be a ruling king of earth and this was the lunar realm. They shifted around him in a pattern of entrapment.<BR>
<BR>
'The moon does not recognize crowns or scepters,' they said, 'nor the representatives of kingdoms below, lion or serpent or mathematician. We are the graves of those that have migrated and become ancient countries. We seek no Queens or thrones. Your appearance is decidedly solar, which is to say a library of stolen ideas. We are neither tear nor sorrow. Our revolution succeeded in the manner that is was written. You are the Hortator and unwelcome here.'<BR>
<BR>
And so Nerevar carved at the grave ghosts until he was out of breath and their Parliament could make no new laws.<BR>
<BR>
He said, 'I am not of the slaves that perish.'<BR>
<BR>
Of the members of Parliament only a few survived the Hortator's attack.<BR>
<BR>
A surviving Crater said, 'Appropriation is nothing new. Everything happens of itself. This motif is by no means unassociated with hero myths. You have not acted with the creative impulse; you fall below the weight of destiny. We are graves but not coffins. Know the difference. You have only dug more and supplied no ghosts to reside within. Central to your claim is the predominance of frail events. To be judged by the earth is to sit on a throne of wonder why. Damage us more and you will find naught but the absence of our dead.'<BR>
<BR>
The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.<BR>

Mushrooms of the Bitter Coast<BR>
Journeyman Report from Ajira<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
Ajira studies four common mushrooms in Vvardenfell.<BR>
<BR>
Luminous Russula is a toadstool like mushroom with a brown spot on top. All Russula has strong odors, but Luminous Russula much stronger. Russula can be poison if not prepared right. When mixed with pearl dust it makes very good potion to breathe under the water.<BR>
<BR>
Violet Coprinus is a tall toadstool that glows in the night. Coprinus also is poison if mixed wrongly like if you mix with Russula. Coprinus mixed with scales lets Ajira walk on the water instead of under the water. Much better.<BR>
<BR>
Bungler's Bane looks like a brown shelf and grows from trees and sometimes wet rocks. Bungler's Bane very bad for you when mixed with almost anything. Very hard to use, but Ajira found Bungler's Bane and left over crushed pearl makes good dispel potion. No bad effects with Ajira's skill, but potion tastes very bad.<BR>
<BR>
Hypha Facia looks just like Bungler's Bane. Confuses Ajira very easily, but Bungler's Bane smells more dry and dusty. Hypha Facia has little smell, but taste is very moist. Hypha Facia very good mushroom for eating, but too much makes Ajira clumsy. Ajira used Hypha Facia to make the nix-hound meat more edible, and Ajira could smell all enchantments in Ajira's room. Ajira found no other use for Hypha Facia.<BR>
<BR>
Ajira works very hard to go all over Bitter Coast and collect all these mushrooms. Ajira deserves rank of Journeyman much sooner than Galbedir.<BR>

Flowers of Lake Amaya<BR>
Journeyman Report of Ajira<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
Ajira studies hard to learn secret magical properties of Gold Kanet, Stoneflower Petals, Willow Anther, and Heather.<BR>
<BR>
Gold Kanet has yellow flowers and very dark green leaves with sharp spines. Gold Kanet and Stoneflower Petals makes a paste that restores strength. The paste has some bad effects, but they last only short time.<BR>
<BR>
Stoneflowers are dark blue and the flowers are very heavy so they bend to the ground. It is very expensive, but Ajira can gain more magicka for a short time by mixing Stoneflower petals with crushed emeralds and water.<BR>
<BR>
Willow flowers are red and very tall with tall and thin leaves also. Willow very good for potions and has many uses. With frost salts, Ajira made a shield of frost. With grave dust and green lichens, Ajira made a potion to cure common diseases. And with Corkbulb Ajira made a potion that can cure paralyzation.<BR>
<BR>
Ajira thinks Heather comes from Skyrim because the leaves look like the spiny leaves of trees in Skyrim. The flowers are also pink like the Nord people. When mixed with ruby, it makes very good potion to make you not weigh so much. With a scrap of Scamp skin, Ajira made a potion to restore personality.<BR>
<BR>
Ajira works very hard to collect these flower samples from the dangerous Lake Amaya. Ajira must do two reports and Galbedir must only do one silly report. Ajira deserves rank of Journeyman very soon now.<BR>

These will be the last words anyone ever hears from me. Hear? That's silly of me. As if anyone will HEAR what I am writing. Regardless, I am a lone traveler and never stayed put long enough to know anyone. Except that lovely Mariah in Stros M'kai. She will forever be in my heart, even in death. To see her again, or to even hear her beautiful voice, would surely allow me to die a content man.<BR>
<BR>
I now lay here with a broken back. Unable to move, surely to be dead within hours. I take this remaining time to write a farewell to this cruel world. The very same one that allowed me to take the path of a thief. A good one at least. If ever you hear tales of Malaki the Lightfooted, you can continue the tale of how you happened across my corpse in a lowly tomb, searching for bounty so I may feed myself. What a life I led. If you too, are a common thief like myself, do yourself a favor, and find another way. If I had it to do all over again, I surely would change my ways.<BR>
<BR>
The clawing and moaning of the ghastly undead beasts grows louder now. I fear they have come to finish me off for good this time. Know that I shall die a painful death as an unhappy man. May the gods show pity on my soul so I do not have to wander this plane after death.<BR>

Alas, Morty, my fallen companion, could not make it this far. I regret that his corpse still holds the key to the tomb I must reach in order to achieve the mission. I am left alone, with only blade and skill to accomplish this task. I believe I have come to the end of my journey. But, without the key, I find myself in the position of forcing entry. For, behind this door, I am sure an evil terror awaits. <BR>
<BR>
I leave this warning in case I do not make it. Surely, this door is trapped, and my lockpicking and disarming ability leaves much to be desired. If someone happens across my body, know that I have failed, and know that there is surely a great prize, the Staff of Hasedoki, awaiting further into this evil tomb. Beware the keeper of the great staff. <BR>

Brother,<BR>
<BR>
I fear by the time you get this writing, I will have been accepted into the hands of death. I am glad you are not here for the onslaught. We are outnumbered, five undead to a man. I don't know how they got in! We swept the halls of this house of the dead, then we locked up. We were alone. Just myself, Pegasai, Jonis, and Luven. As soon as we saw the first wave, it appeared from behind! I have no idea how they were able to surprise us. It's as if they were appearing out of nowhere. Summoned to this position somehow. We fought long and hard, until we could barely hold our weapons up anymore. Jonis was the first one to get cut down. Brother, our longtime friend Jonis, died in front of me in the most horrible way. But do know, he died with the honor of a fighting man. This battle will not be won. Pegasai urged me deeper into the tomb. I saw not Luven, but heard his dying scream come from somewhere within the tomb. I am taking refuge in this main burial chamber. I am here with our due payment from Goris. He will not get it from my living hands. I will hold up until Pegasai comes for me, or until those cursed bonewalkers come to finish me off. <BR>
<BR>
We committed ourselves to aiding Goris in a task, putting our butts on the line, and he promised payment. I'll be damned if he is going to take it back! Brother, if you make it here and find nothing more than my corpse, I hope you can make some sense out of my final letter to you. Avenge your Brother, and your trusting colleagues so that our souls may lay in peace. Goris can be found in a tomb in Tel Mora. We loot and hideout in the occasional tomb, but that sick fool lives in a tomb with his deader companions. Without his knowledge, I forged a key that fits his tomb entry. Use it to gain entry to his lair. Goris should not, and cannot, get the last action. He betrayed us and used us. Avenge my Brother. Avenge!<BR>
<BR>
Live long and may you always be in good health,<BR>
Tyronius<BR>
<BR>

You have served me well over the years. My brother has been trying to stop our business. We've lost over half our shipments recently. The Duke may be my brother, but if he keeps interfering I am afraid he must be killed. I will be next in line and can consolidate my power before the Redorans even come up with a candidate. I am telling you this so that you know the risks you may be taking. If you are unwilling, I will accept your word of honor not to speak of our business. If you stay, I will reward you.<BR>

Tamrielic Artifacts<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
The following are notes I have gathered, over the past centuries, of items of unimaginable significance. All have been seen, owned, and lost, again and again throughout Tamriel. Some may be myth, others may be hoax, but regardless, many have lost their lives attempting to find or protect these very coveted items. <BR>
<BR>
Lord's Mail<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes called the Armor of Morihaus or the gift of Kynareth, this is an ancient cuirass of unsurpassable quality. It grants the wearer power to absorb health, resist the effects of spells, and cure oneself of poison when used. It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the wearer unworthy, the Lord's Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next chosen one.<BR>
<BR>
Ebony Mail<BR>
<BR>
The Ebony Mail is a breastplate created before recorded history by the Dark Elven goddess Boethiah. It is she who determines who should possess the Ebony Mail and for how long a time. If judged worthy, its power grants the wearer added resistance of fire, magicka, and grants a magical shield. It is Boethiah alone who determines when a person is ineligible to bear the Ebony Mail any longer, and the goddess can be very capricious.<BR>
<BR>
Spell Breaker<BR>
<BR>
Spell Breaker, superficially a Dwemer tower shield, is one of the most ancient relics of Tamriel. Aside from its historical importance in the Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder almost completely from any spell caster, either by reflecting magicks or silencing any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that Spell Breaker still searches for its original owner, and will not remain the property of anyone else for long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any length of time is power enough.<BR>
<BR>
Chrysamere<BR>
<BR>
The Paladin's Blade is an ancient claymore with offensive capabilities surpassed only by its own defenses. It lends the wielder health, protects him or her from fire, and reflects any spells cast against the wielder back to the caster. Seldom has Chrysamere been wielded by any bladesman for any length of time, for it chooses not to favor one champion.<BR>
<BR>
Staff of Magnus<BR>
<BR>
The Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a metaphysical battery of sorts for its creator, Magnus. When used, it absorbs an enemy's health and mystical energy. In time, the Staff will abandon the mage who wields it before he becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical balance it is sworn to protect.<BR>
<BR>
Warlock's Ring<BR>
<BR>
The Warlock's Ring of the Archmage Syrabane is one of the most popular relics of myth and fable. In Tamriel's ancient history, Syrabane saved all of the continent by judicious use of his Ring, and ever since, it has helped adventurers with less lofty goals. It is best known for its ability to reflect spells cast at its wearer and to improve his or her speed and to restore health. No adventurer can wear the Warlock's Ring for long, for it is said that the Ring is Syrabane's alone to command.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of Phynaster<BR>
<BR>
The Ring of Phynaster was made hundreds of years ago by a man who needed good defenses to survive his adventurous life. Thanks to the Ring, Phynaster lived for hundreds of years, and since then it has passed from person to person. The Ring improves its wearer's overall resistance to poison, magicka, and shock. Still, Phynaster was cunning and cursed the ring so that it eventually disappears from its holder's possessions and returns to another resting place, discontent to stay anywhere but with Phynaster himself.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of Khajiit<BR>
<BR>
The Ring of the Khajiit is an ancient relic, hundreds of years older than Rajhin, the thief that made the Ring famous. It was Rajhin who used the Ring's powers to make himself invisible and as quick as the breath of wind. Using the Ring, he became the most successful burglar in Elsweyr's history. Rajhin's eventual fate is a mystery, but according to legend, the Ring rebelled against such constant use and disappeared, leaving Rajhin helpless before his enemies.<BR>
<BR>
Mace of Molag Bal<BR>
<BR>
Also known as the Vampire's Mace, the Mace of Molag Bal drains its victims of magicka and gives it to the bearer. It also has the ability to transfer an enemy's strength to its wielder. Molag Bal has been quite free with his artifact. There are many legends about the Mace. It seems to be a favorite for vanquishing wizards. <BR>
<BR>
Masque of Clavicus Vile<BR>
<BR>
Ever the vain one, Clavicus Vile made a masque suited to his own personality. The bearer of the Masque is more likely to get a positive response from the people of Tamriel. The higher his personality, the larger the bonus. The best known story of the Masque tells the tale of Avalea, a noblewoman of some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the Masque in return. Though the Masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a well connected baron, Clavicus Vile reclaimed the Masque. Although pregnant with his child, Avalea was banished from the Baron's household. Twenty one years and one day later, Avalea's daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying the Baron.<BR>
<BR>
Mehrunes Razor<BR>
<BR>
The Dark Brotherhood has coveted this ebony dagger for generations. This mythical artifact is capable of slaying any creature instantly. History does not record any bearers of Mehrune's Razor. However, the Dark Brotherhood was once decimated by a vicious internal power struggle. It is suspected that the Razor was involved.<BR>
<BR>
Cuirass of the Savior's Hide<BR>
<BR>
Another of Hircine's artifacts was the Cuirass of the Savior's Hide. The Cuirass has the special ability to resist magicka. Legend has it that Hircine rewarded his peeled hide to the first and only mortal to have ever escaped his hunting grounds. This unknown mortal had the hide tailored into this magical Cuirass for his future adventures. The Savior's Hide has a tendency to travel from hero to hero as though it has a mind of its own.<BR>
<BR>
Spear of Bitter Mercy<BR>
<BR>
One of the more mysterious artifacts is the Spear of Bitter Mercy. Little to nothing is known about the Spear. There are no recorded histories but many believe it to be of Daedric origin. The only known legend about it is its use by a mighty hero during the fall of the Battlespire. The hero was aided by the Spear in the defeat of Mehrunes Dagon and the recapturing of the Battlespire. Since that time, the Spear of Bitter Mercy has made few appearances within Tamriel.<BR>
<BR>
Daedric Scourge<BR>
<BR>
The Daedric Scourge is a mighty mace forged from sacred ebony in the Fires of Fickledire. The legendary weapon of Mackkan, it was once a fierce weapon used to send spirits of black back into Oblivion. The weapon has the ability to summon creatures from Oblivion, Once a tool used against the Daedric Lords in the Battlespire, it now roams the land with adventurers. <BR>
<BR>
Bow of Shadows<BR>
<BR>
Legend has it that the Bow of Shadows was forged by the Daedra Nocturnal. The legendary ranger, Raerlas Ghile, was granted the Bow for a secret mission that failed, and the Bow was lost. Raerlas did not go down without a hearty fight and is said to have, with the aid of the Bow, taken scores of his foes with him. The Bow grants the user the ability of invisibility and increased speed. Many sightings of the Bow of Shadows have been reported, and it is even said that the sinister Dark Elf assassin of the Second Era, Dram, once wielded this bow.<BR>
<BR>
Fists of Randagulf<BR>
<BR>
Randagulf of Clan Begalin goes down in Tamrielic history as one of the mightiest warriors from Skyrim. He was known for his courage and ferocity in battle and was a factor in many battles. He finally met his fate when King Harald conquered Skyrim. King Harald respected this great hero and took Randagulf's gauntlets for his own. After King Harald died, the gauntlets disappeared. The King claimed that the Fists granted the bearer added strength.<BR>
<BR>
Ice Blade of the Monarch<BR>
<BR>
The Ice Blade of the Monarch is truly one of Tamriel's most prized artifacts. Legend has it that the Evil Archmage Almion Celmo enchanted the claymore of a great warrior with the soul of a Frost Monarch, a stronger form of the more common Frost Atronach. The warrior, Thurgnarr Assi, was to play a part in the assassination of a great king in a far off land, and become the new leader. The assassination failed and the Archmage was imprisoned. The Ice Blade freezes all who feel its blade. The Blade circulates from owner to owner, never settling in one place for long.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of Surroundings<BR>
<BR>
Little is known of this prize but it is said that it lends the wearer the ability to blend in with their surroundings.<BR>
<BR>
Boots of the Apostle<BR>
<BR>
The Boots of the Apostle are a true mystery. The wearer of the boots is rumored to be able to levitate, though nobody has ever seen them used.<BR>
<BR>
The Mentor's Ring<BR>
<BR>
This ring is a prized possession for any apprentice to magic. It lends the wearer the ability to increase their intelligence and wisdom, thus making their use of magic more efficient. The High Wizard Carni Asron is said to be the creator of the Ring. It was a construct for his young apprentices while studying under his guidance. After Asron's death, the Ring and several other possessions vanished and have been circulated throughout Tamriel.<BR>
<BR>
Ring of the Wind<BR>
<BR>
No facts are known about this Ring, but the title and the few rumors lend one to think it grants the wearer added speed.<BR>
<BR>
Vampiric Ring<BR>
<BR>
One of the more deadly and rare artifacts in Tamriel is the Vampiric Ring. It is said that the Ring has the power to steal its victim's health and grant it to the wearer. The exact nature and origin of the Ring is wholly unknown, but many elders speak of its evil creation in Morrowind long, long ago by a cult of Vampire followers. The Vampiric Ring is an extremely rare artifact and is only seen every few hundred cycles of the moons.<BR>
<BR>
Eleidon's Ward<BR>
<BR>
Eleidon was a holy knight of legend in Breton history. He was a sought after man for his courage and determination to set all wrongs right. In one story, it is said that he rescued a Baron's daughter from sure death at the hands of an evil warlord. For his reward, the Baron spent all of his riches to have an enchanted shield built for Eidelon. The Shield granted Eleidon the opportunity to heal his wounds.<BR>
<BR>
Staff of Hasedoki<BR>
<BR>
Hasedoki was said to have been a very competitive wizard. He wandered the land in search for a wizard who was greater than he. To the best of all knowledge, he never found a wizard who could meet up to his challenge. It is said that he felt so lonely and isolated because so many feared his power, that he bonded his life-force into his very own staff, where his soul remains to this very day. Magic users all over Tamriel have been searching for this magical staff. Granting its wielder a protection of magicka, it is a sure prize for any magic user.<BR>
<BR>
Bloodworm Helm<BR>
<BR>
The King of Worms was said to have left behind one of his prized possessions, the Bloodworm Helm. The Helm is a construct of magically formed bone. The Helm allows the user to summon skeletons and control the undead. It would be a prized artifact to a necromancer.<BR>
<BR>
Dragonbone Mail<BR>
<BR>
This cuirass is one of the greatest artifacts any collector or hero could own. It is constructed of real dragon bone and was enchanted by the first Imperial Battlemage, Zurin Arctus, in the early years of the Third Era. It is a truly exquisite piece of work and many have sought to possess it. The properties of the Cuirass allow the wearer to be resist fire, and to damage an enemy with a blast of fire. Little is known about the involvement of Zurin Arctus with the enchantment of the Cuirass, but an old tale speaks of a debt that he owed to a traveling warrior. Like the warrior, the Dragonbone Mail never stays put for long.<BR>
<BR>
Skull Crusher<BR>
<BR>
The Skull Crusher is an amazingly large, and powerful weapon. The Warhammer was created in a fire, magically fueled by the Wizard, Dorach Gusal, and was forged by the great weaponsmith, Hilbongard Rolamus. The steel is magically hardened and the weight of the weapon is amazingly light, which makes for more powerful swings and deadly blows. The Warhammer was to be put on display for a festival, but thieves got it first. The Skull Crusher still travels Tamriel in search of its creators.<BR>
<BR>
Goldbrand<BR>
<BR>
This magical Sword is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient dragons of the North. Their tales claim that it was given to a great knight who was sworn to protect the dragons. The Sword lends its wielder the ability to do fire damage on an enemy. Goldbrand has not been sighted in recent history and is said to be awaiting a worthy hero.<BR>
<BR>
Fang of Haynekhtnamet<BR>
<BR>
Black Marsh was once known to be inhabited with what the Argonians called the Wamasus. Northern men considered them to be intelligent dragons with lightning for blood. One such mighty beast, Haynekhtnamet, was slain by the Northern men, though it took 7 days and nights, and a score of men. One of the surviving men took a fang home as a trophy. The fang was carved down into a blade and fashioned into a small dagger. The Dagger mysteriously houses some of the beast's magical properties and grants the user the ability to do shock damage on an opponent. This unique Dagger is seen occasionally by traveling heroes.<BR>
<BR>
Umbra Sword<BR>
<BR>
The Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch Naenra Waerr, and its sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a soul gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an enemy's soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before she was able to hide the Sword. The Umbra Sword is very choosy when it comes to owners and therefore remains hidden until a worthy one is found.<BR>
<BR>
Denstagmer's Ring<BR>
<BR>
All that is known of this Ring is that it may grant the user protection from certain elements. Even the name Denstagmer is a mystery.<BR>
<BR>
Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw<BR>
<BR>
One of Valenwood's legendary heroes is Oreyn Bearclaw. Son of King Faume Toad-Eye, he was a respected clan hunter and a future leader. Wood Elven legend claims Oreyn single handedly defeated Glenhwyfaunva, the witch-serpent of the Elven wood, forever bringing peace to his clan. Oreyn would go on to accomplish numerous other deeds, eventually losing his life to the Knahaten Flu. His Helm stood as a monument of his stature for future generations to remember. The Helm was lost eventually, as the Clan split, and is now a treasured artifact for adventurers. The Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw is rumored to improve the wearers agility and endurance.<BR>
<BR>
Daedric Crescent Blade<BR>
<BR>
Probably the most rare and even outlawed item of all the great prizes is the Daedric Crescent Blade. The Blade was used by Mehrunes Dagon's Daedric forces in the capture of the Imperial Battlespire. These extremely unique Blades were gathered up and destroyed after the Battlespire was recaptured by the Empire. All but one it seems. Though the Empire believes them all to be destroyed, it is rumored that one still remains in existence, somewhere in Tamriel, though none have ever seen it. The Blade lends its wielder the ability to do great damage on an enemy and allows him to paralyze and put heavy wear on his enemy's armor. Quite the prize for any mighty warrior, if it does indeed exist.<BR>

<BR>
[Addressed outside: ""To my honorable cousin Forven Berano, be this delivered in haste""]<BR>
<BR>
Forven,<BR>
<BR>
I cannot agree. I am a merchant, and have no skill at arms. You are a noble, and in your prime were proven on practice and tournament grounds -- though, in truth, you have never fought a duel, and have few gifts as a liar. No one can doubt Hloggar the Bloody's aptitude and enthusiasm for mayhem, but he is not a subtle man, more suited for a brawl or battlefield than an assassin's role.<BR>
<BR>
And we cannot trust the Dark Brotherhood. Helseth owns them. They promise discretion, but their promises are worthless.<BR>
<BR>
I am afraid we must approach the Morag Tong. I agree with you. They will probably refuse. But at least they can be trusted to be discreet.<BR>
<BR>
If, in the end, we are forced to choose among ourselves, I fear it must be you. And we will have to wrack our brains for some plausible pretext that will get you into Helseth's presence.<BR>
<BR>
I am disappointed, though not surprised, at lack of public outcry over Athyn's murder. The popular sentiment seems to be to avoid personal risk and accept Helseth. It's short-sighted, but understandable. I have noted, however, that the writer of THE COMMON TONGUE is sympathetic to our cause, clever and eloquent. He may be able to sway opinion. We should try to identify this fellow and try to bring him into our counsels.<BR>
<BR>
your faithful servant,<BR>

The Horror of Castle Xyr<BR>
A One Act Play<BR>
by Baloth-Kul<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN=""LEFT""><BR><BR>
Dramatis Personae<BR>
Clavides, Captain of the Imperial Guard. Cyrodilic.<BR>
Anara, a Dunmer maid.<BR>
Ullis, a Lieutenant of the Imperial Guard. Argonian.<BR>
Zollassa, a young Argonian mage.<BR>
<BR>
Late evening. The play opens in the interior Great Entrance Hall of a castle in Scath Anud, replete with fine furnishings and tapestries. Torches provide the only illumination. In the center of the foyer is a great iron door, the main entrance to the castle. The staircase up to the landing above is next to this door. On stage left is the door to the library, which is currently closed. On stage right is a huge suit of armor, twenty feet tall, nearly touching the ceiling of the room. Though no one can be seen, there is the sound of a woman singing coming from the library door.<BR>
<BR>
A loud thumping knock on the iron front door stops the woman's singing. The door to the library opens and ANARA, a common-looking maid, comes out and hurries to open the front door.  CLAVIDES, a handsome man in Imperial garb, stands there.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: Good evening to you, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Good evening. Is your master at home?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: No, serjo, it's only me here. My master, Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr, is at his winter estate. Is there something I can do for you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Possibly. Would you mind if I came in?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: Not at all, serjo. Please. May I offer you some flin?<BR>
<BR>
Clavides comes into the Hall and looks around.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  No, thank you. What's your name?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Anara, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Anara, when did your master leave Scath Anud?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  More than a fortnight ago. That's why it's only me in the castle, serjo. All the other servants and slaves who tend to his lordship travel with him. Is there something wrong?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Yes, there is. Do you know an Ashlander by the name of Sul-Kharifa?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA: No, serjo. I know no one by that name.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Then you aren't likely to now. He's dead. He was found a few hours ago dying of frostbite in the ashlands. He was hysterical, nearly incomprehensible, but among his last words were $93castle$94 and $93Xyr.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Dying of frostbite in summertide in the ashlands? B'vek, that's strange. I suppose it's possible that my master knew this man, but being an ashlander and my master being of the House of Telvanni, well, if you'll pardon me for being flippant, serjo, I don't think they would be friends.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  That is your master's library? Would you mind if I looked in?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Please, serjo, go wherever you want. We have nothing to hide. We're loyal Imperial subjects.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: As, I hear, are all Telvanni.<BR>
<BR>
(Note from the playwright: this line should be delivered without sarcasm. Trust the audience to laugh -- it never fails, regardless of the politics of the locals.)<BR>
<BR>
Clavides enters the library and looks over the books.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  The library needs dusting.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Yes, serjo. I was just doing that when you knocked at the door.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I'm grateful for that. If you had finished, I wouldn't notice the space in the dust where a rather large book has recently been removed. Your master is a wizard, it seems.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  No, serjo. I mean, he studies a lot, but he don't cast no spells, if that's what you mean by wizard. He's a kena, went to college and everything. You know, now that I think about it, I know what happened to that book. One of the other kenas from the college been round yesterday, and borrowed a couple of books. He's a friend of the master, so I thought it'd be all fine.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  This kena, was his name Warvim?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Coulda been. I don't remember.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  There is a suspected necromancer at the college named Kena Warvim we arrested last night. We don't know what he was doing at the college, but it was something illegal, that's for certain. Was that the kena who borrowed the book? A little fellow, a cripple with a withered leg?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  No, serjo, it weren't the kena from yesterday. He was a big fella who could walk, so I noticed.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: I'm going to have a look around the rest of the house, if you don't mind.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides goes up the stairs, and delivers the following dialogue from the landing and the rooms above. Anara continues straightening up the downstairs, moving a high-backed bench in front of the armor to scrub the floor.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Can I ask, serjo, what you're looking for? Maybe I could help you.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Are these all the rooms in the castle? No secret passages?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA (laughing):  Oh, serjo, what would Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr want with secret passages?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (looking at the armor):  Your master is a big man.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA (laughing):  Oh, serjo, don't tease. That's giant armor, just for decoration.  My master slew that giant ten years ago, and kind of keeps it for a souvenir.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  That's right, I remember hearing something about that when I first took my post here. It was someone named Xyr who killed the giant, but I didn't think the first name was Hordalf. Memory fades, I'm afraid. What was the giant's name?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I'm afraid I don't remember, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I do. It was Torfang. $93I got out of Torfang's Shield.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I don't understand, serjo. Torfang's shield?<BR>
<BR>
Clavides runs down the stairs, and examines the armor.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES: Sul-Kharifa said something about getting out of Torfang's shield. I thought he was just raving, out of his mind.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  But he ain't got a shield, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides pushes the high-backed bench out of the way, revealing the large mounted shield at the base of the armor.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Yes, he does. You covered it up with that bench.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  I didn't do it on purpose, serjo! I was just cleaning! I see that armor every day, serjo, and b'vek I swear I ain't never noticed the shield before!<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It's fine, Anara, I believe you.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides pushes on the shield and it pulls back to reveal a tunnel down.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It appears that Sedura Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr does have a need for a secret passage. Could you get me a torch?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  B'vek, I ain't never seen that before!<BR>
<BR>
Anara takes a torch from the wall, and hands it to Clavides. Clavides enters the tunnel.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Wait here.<BR>
<BR>
Anara watches Clavides disappear down the tunnel. She appears agitated, and finally runs for the front door. When she opens it, ULLIS, an Argonian lieutenant in the Imperial guard is standing at the entrance. She screams.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  I'm sorry to frighten you.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Not now! Go away!<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  I'm afraid the Captain wouldn't like that, miss.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  You're... with the Captain? Blessed mother.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides comes out of the tunnel, white-faced. It takes him a few moments to speak.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Captain? What's down there?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (to Anara):  Did you know your master's a necromancer? That your cellar is filled with bodies?<BR>
<BR>
Anara faints. Ullis carries her to the bench and lays her down.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Let me see, serjo.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  You'll see soon enough. We're going to need every soldier from the post here to cart away all the corpses. Ullis, I've seen enough battles, but I've never seen anything like this. No two are alike.  Khajiiti, sload, dunmer, cyrodiil, breton, nord, burned alive, poisoned, electrified, melted, torn apart, turned inside out, ripped to shreds and sewn back up together.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  You think the Ashlander escaped, that's what happened?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I don't know. Why would someone do something like this, Ullis?<BR>
<BR>
There is a knock on the door. Clavides answers it. A young Argonian woman, ZOLLASSA, is standing, holding a package and a letter.<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Good morning, you're not Lord Xyr, are you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  No. What do you have there?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  A letter and a package I'm supposed to deliver to him. Will he be back shortly?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  I don't believe so. Who gave you the package to deliver?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  My teacher at the college, Kema Warvim. He has a bad leg, so he asked me to bring these to his lordship. Actually, to tell you the truth, I was supposed to deliver them last night, but I was busy.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Greetings, sistre. We'll give the package to his lordship when we see him.<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Ah, hail, brothre. I had heard there was a handsome Argonian in Scath Anud. Unfortunately, I promised Kema Warvim that I'd deliver the package directly to his lordship's hands. I'm already late, I can't just --<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  We're Imperial Guard, miss. We will take the package and the letter.<BR>
<BR>
Zollassa reluctantly hands Clavides the letter and the package. She turns to go.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  You're at the college, if we need to see you?<BR>
<BR>
ZOLLASSA:  Yes. Fare tidings, brothre.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Goodnight, sistre.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides opens the package as Zollassa exits. It is a book with many loose sheets.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  It appears we've found the missing book. Delivered to our very hands.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides begins to read the book, silently to himself.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (to himself, very pleased): Another Argonian in Scath Anud. And a pretty one, at that. I hope we weren't too rude to her. I'm tired of all these women with their smooth, wet skin, it would be wonderful if we could meet when I'm off duty.  <BR>
<BR>
While Ullis talks, he opens the letter and reads it.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (continued):  She looks like she's from the south, like me. You know, Argonians from northern Black Marsh are... much... less...<BR>
<BR>
Ullis continues reading, transfixed by the letter. Clavides skips to the back of the book, and reads the last sentences.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES (reading): In black ink $93The Khajiiti male showed surprisingly little fortitude against a simple lightning spell, but I've had interesting physiological results with a medium-level acid spell cast slowly over several days.$94 In red ink on the margins, $93Yes, I see. Was the acid spell cast uniformly over the entire body of the subject?$94 In black ink $93The Nord female was subjected to sixteen hours of a frost spell which eventually crystalized her into a state of suspended animation, from which she eventually expired. Not so the Nord male, nor the Ashlander male who lapsed into their comas much earlier, but then recovered. The Ashlander then tried to escape, but I restrained him. The Nord then had an interesting chemical overreaction to a simple fire spell and expired. See the accompanying illustration.$94 In red ink, $93Yes, I see. The pattern of boils and lesions suggest some sort of internal incineration perhaps caused by the combination of a short burst of flame following a longer session with frost. It's such a shame I can't come to see the experiment personally, but I compliment you on your excellent notation.$94 In black ink, $93Thank you for the suggestion about slowly poisoning my maid Anara. The dosages you've suggested have had fascinating results, eroding her memory very subtly. I intend to increase it expotentially and see how long it is before she notices. Speaking of which, it is a pity that I haven't any Argonian subjects, but the slave-traders promise me some healthy specimens in the autumn. I should like to test their metabolism in comparison to elves and humans. It's my theory that a medium-level lightning spell cast in a continuous wave on an Argonian wouldn't be lethal for several hours at least, similiar to my results with the Cyrodilic female and, of course, the giant.$94 In red ink, $93It'd be a shame to wait until autumn to see.$94<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS (reading the letter):  In red ink, $93Here is your Argonian. Please let me know the results.$94 It's signed $93Kema Warvim.$94<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  By Kynareth, this isn't necromancy. It's Destruction. Kema Warvim and Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr haven't been experimenting with death, but with the limits of magical torture.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  The letter isn't addressed to Kena Telvanni Hordalf Xyr. It's addressed to Sedura Iachilla Xyr. His wife, do you think?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Iachilla.  That was the Telvanni of the Xyr family who I heard about in connection with the giant slaying. We'd best get the maid out of here. She'll need to go to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
Clavides wakes up Anara.  She appears disoriented.<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  What's happening? Who are you?<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  Don't worry, everything is going to be fine. We're going to take you to a healer.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  Do you need a coat, Iachilla?<BR>
<BR>
ANARA:  Thank you, no, I'm not cold --<BR>
<BR>
Anara/Iachilla stops, realizing that she's been caught. Clavides and Ullis unsheathe their blades.<BR>
<BR>
CLAVIDES:  You have black ink on your fingers, your ladyship.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  And when you saw me at the door, you thought I was the Argonian your friend Warvim sent over. That's why you said, $93Not now. Go away.$94<BR>
<BR>
ANARA/IACHILLA:  You're much more observant than Anara. She never did understand what was happening, even when I tripled the poison spell and she expired in what I observed as considerable agony.<BR>
<BR>
ULLIS:  What were you going to use on me first, lightning or fire?<BR>
<BR>
ANANA/IACHILLA:  Lightning. I find fire to be too unpredictable.<BR>
<BR>
As she speaks, the flames in the torchs extinguish. The stage is utterly dark.<BR>
<BR>
There is the sound of a struggle, swords clanging. Suddenly a bolt of lightning flashes out, and there is silence. From the darkness, Anana/Iachilla speaks.<BR>
<BR>
ANANA/IACHILLA: Fascinating.<BR>
<BR>
There are several more flashes of lightning as the curtain closes.<BR>
<BR>
THE END.<BR>

""Sit quietly, Child, and listen, for the story I tell you is a story of the ages.""<BR>
<BR>
""But what is it, Grandfather? Is it a story of heroes and beasts?""<BR>
<BR>
The Grandfather looked patiently at the Child. He was growing into a fine boy. Soon he would see the value in the stories, the lessons that were taught to each generation.<BR>
""Just listen, Child. Let the story take root in your heart.""<BR>
<BR>
----------<BR>
<BR>

In a time before now, long before now, when the Skaal were new, there was peace in the Land. The sun was hot and the crops grew long, and the people were happy in the peace that the All-Maker provided. But, the Skaal grew complacent and lazy, and they took for granted the Lands and all the gifts the All-Maker had given them. They forgot, or chose not to remember, that the Adversary is always watching, and that he delights in tormenting the All-Maker and his chosen people. And so it was that the Adversary came to be among the Skaal.<BR>
<BR>
The Adversary has many aspects. He appears in the unholy beasts and the incurable plague. At the End of Seasons, we will know him as Thartaag the World-Devourer. But in these ages he came to be known as the Greedy Man. <BR>
<BR>
The Greedy Man (that is what we call him, for to speak his name would certainly bring ruin on the people) lived among the Skaal for many months. Perhaps he was once just a man, but when the Adversary entered into him, he became the Greedy Man, and that is how he is remembered.<BR>
<BR>
It came to be one day that the powers of the Skaal left them. The strength left the arms of the warriors, and the shaman could no longer summon the beasts to their side. The elders thought that surely the All-Maker was displeased, and some suggested that the All-Maker had left them forever. It was then that the Greedy Man appeared to them and spoke.<BR>
<BR>
""You of the Skaal have grown fat and lazy. I have stolen the gifts of your All-Maker. I have stolen the Oceans, so you will forever know thirst. I have stolen the Lands and the Trees and the Sun, so your crops will wither and die. I have stolen the Beasts, so you will go hungry. And I have stolen the Winds, so you will live without the Spirit of the All-Maker.<BR>
<BR>
""And until one of you can reclaim these gifts, the Skaal will live in misery and despair. For I am the Greedy Man, and that is my nature.""<BR>
<BR>
And the Greedy Man disappeared.<BR>
<BR>
The members of the Skaal spoke for many days and nights. They knew that one of them must retrieve the Gifts of the All-Maker, but they could not decide who it should be.<BR>
<BR>
""I cannot go,"" said the Elder, ""for I us must stay to lead the Skaal, and tell our people what is the law.""<BR>
<BR>
""I cannot go,"" said the Warrior, ""for I must protect the Skaal. My sword will be needed in case the Greedy Man reappears.""<BR>
<BR>
""I cannot go,"" said the Shaman, ""for the people need my wisdom. I must read the portents and offer my knowledge.""<BR>
<BR>
It was then that a young man called Aevar lifted his voice. He was strong of arm, and fleet of foot, though he was not yet a warrior of the Skaal. <BR>
<BR>
""I will go,"" said Aevar, and the Skaal laughed. <BR>
<BR>
""Hear me out,"" the boy continued. ""I am not yet a warrior, so my sword will not be needed. I cannot read the portents, so the people will not seek my counsel. And I am young, and not yet wise in the ways of the law. I will retrieve the Gifts of the All-Maker from the Greedy Man. If I cannot, I will not be missed.""<BR>
<BR>
The Skaal thought on this briefly, and decided to let Aevar go. He left the village the next morning to retrieve the Gifts.<BR>
<BR>
Aevar first set out to retrieve the Gift of Water, so he traveled to the Water Stone. It was there the All-Maker first spoke to him.<BR>
<BR>
""Travel west to the sea and follow the Swimmer to the Waters of Life.""<BR>
<BR>
So Aevar walked to the edge of the ocean, and there was the Swimmer, a Black Horker, sent from the All-Maker. The Swimmer dove into the waters and swam very far, and far again. Aevar was strong, though, and he swam hard. He followed the Swimmer to a cave, swimming deeper and deeper, his lungs burning and his limbs exhausted. At last, he found a pocket of air, and there, in the dark, he found the Waters of Life. Gathering his strength, he took the Waters and swam back to the shore.<BR>
<BR>
Upon returning to the Water Stone, the All-Maker spoke. ""You have returned the Gift of Water to the Skaal. The Oceans again will bear fruit, and their thirst will be quenched.""<BR>
<BR>
Aevar then traveled to the Earth Stone, and there the All-Maker spoke to him again.<BR>
<BR>
""Enter the Cave of the Hidden Music, and hear the Song of the Earth.""<BR>
<BR>
So Aevar traveled north and east to the Cave of the Hidden Music. He found himself in a large cavern, where the rocks hung from the ceiling and grew from the ground itself. He listened there, and heard the Song of the Earth, but it was faint. Grabbing up his mace, he struck the rocks of the floor in time with the Song, and the Song grew louder, until it filled the cavern and his heart. Then he returned to the Earth Stone.<BR>
<BR>
""The Gift of the Earth is with the Skaal again,"" said the All-Maker. ""The Lands are rich again, and will bear life.""<BR>
<BR>
Aevar was tired, as the Sun burned him, the trees offered no shade, and there was no wind to cool him. Still, he traveled on to the Beast Rock, and the All-Maker spoke.<BR>
<BR>
""Find the Good Beast and ease his suffering.""<BR>
<BR>
Aevar traveled through the woods of the Isinfier for many hours until he heard the cries of a bear from over a hill. As he crested a hill, he saw the bear, a Falmer's arrow piercing its neck. He checked the woods for the Falmer (for that is what they were, though some say they are not), and finding none, approached the beast. He spoke soothing words and came upon it slowly, saying, ""Good Beast, I mean you no harm. The All-Maker has sent me to ease your suffering.""<BR>
<BR>
Hearing these words, the bear ceased his struggles, and laid his head at Aevar's feet. Aevar grasped the arrow and pulled it from the bear's neck. Using the little nature magic he knew, Aevar tended the wound, though it took the last bit of his strength. As the bear's wound closed, Aevar slept.<BR>
<BR>
When he awoke, the bear stood over him, and the remains of a number of the Falmer were strewn about. He knew that the Good Beast had protected him during the night. He traveled back to Beast Rock, the bear by his side, and the All-Maker spoke to him again.<BR>
<BR>
""You have returned the Gift of the Beasts. Once again, the Good Beasts will feed the Skaal when they are hungry, clothe them when they are cold, and protect them in times of need.""<BR>
<BR>
Aevar's strength had returned, so he traveled on to the Tree Stone, though the Good Beast did not follow him. When he arrived, the All-Father spoke to him.<BR>
<BR>
""The First Trees are gone, and must be replanted. Find the seed and plant the First Tree.""<BR>
<BR>
Aevar traveled again through the Hirstaang Forest, searching for the seeds of the First Tree, but he could find none. Then he spoke to the Tree Spirits, the living trees. They told him that the seeds had been stolen by one of the Falmer (for they are the servants of the Adversary), and this Falmer was hiding them deep in the forest, so that none would ever find them.<BR>
<BR>
Aevar traveled to the deepest part of the forest, and there he found the evil Falmer, surrounded by the Lesser Tree Spirits. Aevar could see that the Spirits were in his thrall, that he had used the magic of the Seeds and spoken their secret name. Aevar knew he could not stand against such a force, and that he must retrieve the seeds in secret. <BR>
<BR>
Aevar reached into his pouch and drew out his flint. Gathering leaves, he started a small fire outside the clearing where the Falmer and the ensorcelled Spirits milled. All the Skaal know the Spirits' hatred of fires, for the fires ravage the trees they serve. At once, the Nature of the Spirits took hold, and they rushed to quell the flames. During the commotion, Aevar snuck behind the Falmer and snatched the pouch of Seeds, stealing away before the evil being knew they were gone.<BR>
<BR>
When Aevar returned to the Tree Stone, he planted the tree in the ground, and the All-Maker spoke to him.<BR>
<BR>
""The Gift of Trees is restored. Once again, the Trees and Plants will bloom and grow, and provide nourishment and shade.""<BR>
<BR>
Aevar was tired, for the Sun would only burn, and the Winds would not yet cool him, but he rested briefly in the shade of the Trees. His legs were weary and his eyes heavy, but he continued on, traveling to the Sun Stone. Again, the All-Maker spoke.<BR>
<BR>
""The gentle warmth of the Sun is stolen, so now it only burns. Free the Sun from the Halls of Penumbra.""<BR>
<BR>
And so Aevar walked west, over the frozen lands until he reached the Halls of Penumbra. The air inside was thick and heavy, and he could see no farther than the end of his arm. Still, he felt his way along the walls, though he heard the shuffling of feet and knew that this place held the Unholy Beasts who would tear his flesh and eat his bones. For hours he crept along, until he saw a faint glow far at the end of the hall. <BR>
<BR>
There, from behind a sheet of perfect ice, came a glow so bright he had to shut his eyes, lest they be forever blinded. He plucked the flaming eye from one of the Unholy Beasts and threw it at the ice with all his might. A small crack appeared in the ice, then grew larger. Slowly, the light crept out between the cracks, widening them, splitting the ice wall into pieces. With a deafening crack, the wall crumbled, and the light rushed over Aevar and through the Halls. He heard the shrieks of the Unholy Beasts as they were blinded and burned. He ran out of the Halls, following the light, and collapsed on the ground outside.<BR>
<BR>
When he was able to rise again, the Sun again warmed him, and he was glad for that. He traveled back to the Sun Stone, where the All-Maker spoke to him.<BR>
<BR>
""The Gift of the Sun is the Skaal's once again. It will warm them and give them light.""<BR>
<BR>
Aevar had one final Gift he had to recover, the Gift of the Winds, so he traveled to the Wind Stone, far on the western coast of the island. When he arrived, the All-Maker spoke to him, giving him his final task.<BR>
<BR>
""Find the Greedy Man and release the Wind from its captivity.""<BR>
<BR>
So, Aevar wandered the land in search of the Greedy Man. He looked in the trees, but the Greedy Man did not hide there. Nor did he hide near the oceans, or the deep caves, and the beasts had not seen him in the dark forests. Finally, Aevar came to a crooked house, and he knew that here he would find the Greedy Man.<BR>
<BR>
""Who are you,"" shouted the Greedy Man, ""that you would come to my house?""<BR>
<BR>
""I am Aevar of the Skaal,"" said Aevar. ""I am not warrior, shaman, or elder. If I do not return, I will not be missed. But I have returned the Oceans and the Earth, the Trees, the Beasts, and the Sun, and I will return the Winds to my people, that we may feel the spirit of the All-Maker in our souls again."" <BR>
<BR>
And with that, he grabbed up the Greedy Man's bag and tore it open. The Winds rushed out with gale force, sweeping the Greedy Man up and carrying him off, far from the island. Aevar breathed in the Winds and was glad. He walked back to the Wind Stone, where the All-Maker spoke to him a final time.<BR>
<BR>
""You have done well, Aevar. You, the least of the Skaal, have returned my gifts to them. The Greedy Man is gone for now, and should not trouble your people again in your lifetime. Your All-Maker is pleased. Go now, and live according to your Nature.""<BR>
<BR>
And Aevar started back to the Skaal village.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
----------<BR>
<BR>

""And then what happened, Grandfather?""<BR> 
<BR>
""What do you mean, Child? He went home.""<BR>
<BR>
""No. When he returned to the village,"" the Child continued. ""Was he made a warrior? Or taught the ways of the shaman? Did he lead the Skaal in battle?""<BR>
<BR>
""I do not know. That is where the story ends,"" said the Grandfather.<BR>
<BR>
""But that is not an ending! That is not how stories end!""<BR>
<BR>
The old man laughed and got up from his chair.<BR>
<BR>
""Is it not?""<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

The two of us together can certainly find her, and kill the foul beasts should they show themselves again."

I must admit, though, I'm growing weary of patching together the same old wolf and bear pelts.

Oh, and %PCName...I trust you'll keep this between the two of us. I wish I could offer some kind of reward, but I have so little. I know -- I shall leave the draugr's treasure be.
