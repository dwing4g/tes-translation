> SCPT.SCTX PC_m1_Varla_GarAge_sc m1
As you pick up the stone, you're struck by an unprecedented sense of clarity. The intricacies of your mind become apparent as understanding pierces you in waves. But as the sensation becomes more acute, your thoughts begin to turn in on themselves, overlapping into noise as they dissect each other with agonizing efficiency. And then it is over.
###

> SCPT.SCTX PC_m1_Varla_GarAge_sc m2
OK
###

> SCPT.SCTX PC_m1_Varla_GarMal_sc m1
The stone, so cold when you first touched it, rapidly warms in your grip. As it does, your mind is filled with images and feelings. Success. Satisfaction. A complete and overwhelming sense of self-actualization. But it soon fades, and you're left with an aching void where it once was. You return to reality feeling its loss far more vividly than you did its presence.
###

> SCPT.SCTX PC_m1_Varla_GarMal_sc m2
OK
###

> SCPT.SCTX PC_m1_Varla_Gulaida_sc m1
This stone feels somehow heavy in a way that has nothing to do with its weight. As you take it, your mind is filled with violent, decisive resolutions to every inconvenience you've ever faced, and you find yourself becoming entranced by them. Rousing, you notice that you're gripping the stone so tightly it should draw blood, and yet nothing flows.
###

> SCPT.SCTX PC_m1_Varla_Gulaida_sc m2
OK
###

> SCPT.SCTX PC_m1_Varla_Lindasael_sc m1
Upon touching the stone, you feel a surge of energy flow across you. Wherever it passes, your body's flaws make themselves known in excruciating detail. Your strained, trembling muscles. Your creaking, flimsy bones. The energy settles to a barely noticeable hum as you reassert yourself over your skin, which feels as stiff and fragile as glass where the stone touches it.

###

> SCPT.SCTX PC_m1_Varla_Wormusoel_sc m1
In the moment you take the stone, it's as if a veil has been lifted. In and around you, permeating all things, there is a dense web of emotion, plots, and purpose -- and it hates you. In your mind's eye, you see a million sets of fangs and a million swords raised against your innermost being. The experience is over quickly, but the paranoia it instills in you lasts far longer.

"""<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Magic Cards"><BR>
Dear Kha'Raji,<BR><BR>
I hope this missive finds you well. I provide rhetorical and oratorical instruction at the College of Firewatch in Morrowind. I read transcripts of your recent speeches in Cyrodiil regarding the virtues of abolitionism and the vices of slavery. I found both the content and style of your words to be passionate, inspiring, persuasive, and clear. I believe my students would greatly benefit from your experience as a prominent and outspoken orator.<BR><BR>
Ergo, I am writing to provide you with an offer of employment at our prestigious institution. You would be serving as an assistant professor of rhetoric and oratorical style under myself, with all rights and privileges afforded to our faculty. Of course, I understand you have a home and family in Anvil. As it is not my intention to uproot you from them, I have prepared a proposal to our College's headmaster on your behalf -- a new study abroad program in Cyrodiil for our students.<BR><BR>
My plan for our new study abroad program is as follows. Initially, you would teach classes in Firewatch with me for a time while we iron out the program's details. After you learn how our College operates, you would be free to return to Anvil. Periodically, we would transfer students to you from Morrowind to instruct in the art of oration. Graduates of your class would be free to stay in Cyrodiil to pursue other studies, if they so choose.<BR><BR>
Please let my courier know whether our offer of assistant professorship is acceptable to you. The College and I look forward to your answer, whatever it may be.<BR><BR>					
Sincerely,<BR>
Walks-Through-Shadow<BR>
Professor of Rhetoric and Oratorical Style<BR>

...After days of searching through the chambers of this ancient castle, I was ecstatic to have discovered the grand library of Garlas Agea. And, oh, grand it is, indeed! I knew I was the first to lay eyes on these hallowed halls in millenia, perhaps the first unbound man in history. I began poring over scroll after stiff, crumbling scroll, and tracing etching after faded, corroded etching. It must have been weeks since last I've seen the sun, now. All I'm left with is this cold, manufactured starlight.<BR>
<BR>
Upon entering the library, I discovered a stone door that, unlike the many others in this ruin, didn't respond to any of the keystones I had collected, nor brute force. I assumed at first that I had simply not found the keystone and resolved to return later, to instead focus on collecting the lore this library had to offer. My discoveries in this library though, lead me to a fascinating conclusion: the door was to be opened by an incantation, but in weeks of research, I could not find it. When I realized that my rations had run out, I left, ecstatic about my findings, recorded here in this journal, but glum nonetheless that I had not discovered the secret to this door.<BR>
<BR>
I discovered then that by some arcane means, the door I had came through had been entirely sealed. It, much like the door on the story below, now no longer responded to my touch or to my keys. I suspect this to be the work of one of the many protective spirits that wanders this castle, simply going about its habits with no mind for the mortal it doesn't even know is within. Days on, I have resigned myself to my death.<BR>
<BR>
I refuse, however, to let my death be in vain. I dedicate this final entry to you, whoever discovers this notebook. My dying wish is for this to be published, for all my findings in this accursed library to be revealed to the world. I spent my last days starving, reading through more and more texts and recording them in this journal.<BR>
<BR>
Then, I had hope: I had found the incantation to open the door. I scrambled to the door, overjoyed, and opened my mouth to say aloud the incantation.<BR>
<BR>
Nought but dust came from my mouth. I was too weak to speak. Damn.<BR>
<BR>
I can only hope that you who discover this has the will to speak the incantation. I have recorded it as follows.<BR>

Dear Cerdia,
<BR>
I truly hope this message finds you well.
<BR>
This is the sixth follow up letter I am attempting to send you, not including my two regularly scheduled messages that have received no response. I have moved past the idea that this is an unfortunate coincidence and know without a doubt that you are being somehow prevented from responding. I can only hope that my letters are still ending up in your hands.
<BR>
To tell the truth, I'm something of a wreck right now. I knew something was wrong as soon as my first letter went without response, but I only began to fear the worst as time passed and my follow up letters did as well. I must assume that you are suffering some sort of illness that makes it impossible to write back. I wish I was able to travel to Archad to be there for you, but that's sadly impossible right now. However, I have a plan to send you help.
<BR>
I've been actively attempting to recruit someone to assist you, but I'm sure you recall from my previous letters what I think of Goldstone's people. I doubt anyone in permanent residence here cares enough for anyone but themselves. Therefore, I must hope that a traveler from outside the castle is willing to make the trip. Depending on how long it takes to find this person, I may send the letter with them instead of through normal means.
<BR>
I hope it goes without saying that I am greatly looking forward to your recovery and response. I've felt the lack of your correspondence keenly, but that's only part of why it brings me so much joy to come to your aid. The other part is that I know you'd do the same for me.

At the time, Imperial naval power was stretched thin, consumed by the Akavir campaign led by Emperor Uriel V.<BR>

Taking advantage of the situation, a vampiric fleet began attacking Abecean vessels at night, leaving the bloodied ships void of treasure and life.

At the most perilous hour, an unnamed Nightblade appeared at the court of Goldstone. He pledged his sword to Dibella, whose great temple was still under construction, and vowed to bring back the heads of the ghastly captains. Three months later he reappeared before the aging King Conomorus, presenting the evidence as promised. The fleet was never seen again.

"""<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Magic Cards"><BR>
<BR>
Bluepox is a Pyandonean disease inflicted by a species of native wildlife. Members of this species secrete a toxic substance in their mouth which spreads the disease. The substance is sometimes harvested by local Maormer as an instrument of war, but it requires magical enhancement to keep its effectiveness on long journies.
<BR>
Aside from the blue spots of pox which give the disease its name, almost all victims experience seizures. Severity increases gradually; in the worst cases, the victim can be completely incapacitated by full-body spasms. Finally, sufferers exhibit a heightened sensitivity to electric shocks.
<BR>
The disease can be cured through typical means, but if cures are unavailable I do know of a few ways to minimize the symptoms. The first priority should be to remove the victim from anything dangerous they could flail into. Bedrest should be encouraged if possible. Alternatively, a weak paralysis effect can be used to prevent the seizures. In extreme cases, physically binding the victim's limbs to their body and supporting their head with something soft will prevent the disease's worst effects.

O,
<BR>
Excellent work so far. You will find your payment at the usual location, but be cautious when collecting it. The incidents being so close together will attract unwanted eyes. Expect increased scrutiny upon you.
<BR>
This is not to say that you should be panicking. Assuming the issue is raised, an investigation will be carried out. You must be inconspicuous enough to endure it without being noticed. This will be easier than it may seem -- T has a limited attention span and an even more limited pool of competent subordinates.
<BR>
Consider our deal paused for the moment. I will send another letter when I believe it safe for you to act again.

"""<DIV ALIGN="left"><FONT COLOR="000000" SIZE="3" FACE="Magic Cards"><BR>Addressed to Tiledorus Cadmerius, Navarch and Admiral of the West Navy.<BR>
<BR>
Navarch Cadmerius, it has come to my attention that many merchant vessels sailing by Stirk Isle in the past months have been attacked and plundered of their goods. As the highest agent of Imperial law on Charach, these incidents naturally fall under my purview. But though the soldiers under my command may be loyal and brave, there are not many of them, and certainly not enough to steward the entirety of the near Abecean.<BR>
<BR>
While I understand the Navy's hesitation to spend more of its funds than necessary on performing such a task itself, I would ask you to seriously reconsider your recent abandonment of Duskwatch Keep. This move has clearly emboldened any would-be outlaws to further criminality, and has begun to severely hamper trade. Even one or two ships regularly patrolling the waters around Stirk Isle could greatly lessen the current burden on the Kingdom of Anvil to keep the seas safe, without putting undue strain on your budget.<BR>
<BR>
From Villina Telvor, Marshal of the Isles and representative of the Kingdom of Anvil on Charach.<BR>"""

Entry 74:<BR>
Departing from Anvil today. The skies are clear, and the journey to Charach isn't far, but I've heard that more pirates have taken to the near Abecean since the Navy left. Maybe it's nothing to be too concerned about, but we should still be cautious.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 75:<BR>
The good weather continues. If the winds stay favorable, we should be arriving at Charach in a day or two.<BR>
<BR>
Entry 76:<BR>
We appear to have a few small vessels following us. It looks like we picked them up while traveling through the Viduscan Isles, and they're manned -- if you'll excuse the pun -- by goblins. We're attempting to outrun them, but they move surprisingly fast.<BR><BR>
Entry 77:<BR>
They've caught up to us. It didn't even look particularly difficult, either. They seem to have made a sport out of it, pulling back enough that we think we've lost their skiffs, and then speeding ahead again until they're practically on top of us. Everyone knows that we're not prepared enough to stop this ship from sinking, but at this point fighting them off is the only plan worth trying.<BR>

The Black Isle Company is officially licensed in Anvil as a wholesaler and distributor for the East Empire Company. That means we buy stuff from the EEC and sell it to other businesses. If they've done their research, it's probably going to come up that we haven't actually sold anything in Anvil yet. Try and pass it off as a temporary logistics issue or something.
<BR>
Pretending to be connected to the East Empire Company was essential to getting us established, but that connection doesn't hold up to serious scrutiny. Don't draw too much attention to it. The EEC doesn't know anything about us, and half of our startup coin has been going towards making sure it stays that way.
<BR>
I've been pushing the narrative that the Black Isle Company is already established and well regarded back in Vvardenfell. We might be the new company on the block here, but don't suggest we don't know what we're doing.
<BR>
Speaking of, whenever possible, try and tie the interview back to Vvardenfell. Most peoples' knowledge of it around here boils down to 'ash, slavery, and mines'. If you sound confident enough, you could get them to believe pretty much anything about it. Perfect for dodging a tricky question.

Thank you again for organizing the festival. It went just as you said, and the textile industry has bounced back stronger than ever. Your militia recruitment drive has also been doing wonders with the townsmen, and Rihad's never seemed so full of life.<BR><BR>
All the more a pity that you're leaving. Anvil's another world, but I'm sure you'll take to it like a fish to water. If you need me to put in a good word with any of my contacts there, send a courier my way and consider it done.<BR>
<BR>
Power to the Republic!<BR>
Raha Treigo<BR>

Nymona Aurix, an amateur naturalist in the Charach Mages Guild, asked me to help her find a rare seadrake egg. Supposedly, sea drakes were once known to live in the Abecean Sea, but none have been seen in many years. Nymona asked me to visit Fort Telodrach and speak to Stelane Maruthine, an expert Navy naturalist currently in Anvil.

As the fishermen count the hours, the eyes set on their line, they address their prayers to the Dragon-God of Time. Hence the reason of Akatosh's popularity around here. We shun the pomp found in other cults and ceremonies of the Great Faiths, to celebrate the virtues of patience and modesty embodied by the fishermen of Thresvy.
###

In small villages like Thresvy, the local priest also serves as resident healer, mage and alchemist. No apothecaries, no guildhalls, no general traders... It's a tall order for a single woman! I know priests of Akatosh are often dismissive of the Itinerant Priests, but I don't care. I try to help the chapel as much as I can: I brought supplies from Anvil when I arrived, I gather ingredients around the village... up until it'll be time for me to move on to somewhere else.

Our order is dedicated to the worship of blessed Morihaus, firstborn of Kynareth, who descended from the heavens to fight alongside humankind in sacred war against the ancient Ayleids. The First Breath of Man married Saint Alessia, and together they founded the first Empire. The Great Faiths have revered him ever since. Here at the Temple of the First Breath, we honor Morihaus for his role in our mythic history and pray for his benedictions as master of storms and protector of the righteous.

The Bull-god Morihaus is worshipped across Cyrodiil, particularly in the Nibenay. Son of Kynareth and father of the first Imperial dynasty, he is considered a fertility symbol by Niben rice farmers, a symbol of authority for the eastern merchant-elites, and a master of border stones and ancient demarcations. His importance has waned under the Septim Empire, but the priesthood of Morihaus maintains a temple-complex in Vengheto, and the region of Mor's Ambit in northeast Colovia is named for him.

I'll be honest with you. The coal we get from Fort Heath is expensive. The mine reserves most of their coal for Legion use, and there's not much supply left for purchase. But it allows us to keep the Sacred Baths and other facilities of the temple consistently in operation. That keeps our devout worshippers and prominent patrons happy, so the temple spares no expense to keep buying it.

I'll be frank with you: the Marshal's financial situation is somewhat precarious. This may come as a surprise. It's true that his position provides ample opportunites for the raising of capital, but the Marshal is often prone to excess.

###

> INFO.NAME chapel of crimson strings 718926948216792810
It is a strange name, from a layman's point of view. So let me explain it. Crimson is the color of love to the Great Faiths, and is ubiquitous in Colovian weddings. As for the strings, they symbolize that love is both a bond and a bind. For two beings to form the deepest of relationships, both must lose some of their freedom. Mara shuns the licentious, and doesn't care for short embraces. Only by tying themselves together can souls be made truly whole.

He was said to be a tyrannical Ayleid sorcerer-king. He ruled the Strident Coast thousands of years ago from Garlas Malatar. The Ayleid citadels of Beldaburo, Vabriasael, Nagaiarelle, and Wormusoel were also under his reign. I heard he was entombed alive in his palace during the Alessian rebellion.

These eastern merchants and bureaucrats have undone the rule of the old Colovian houses of Stirk Isle. The island suffers under their yoke. If I am to restore the good name of the Pelladia, everyone must first be reminded of our true Nordic ancestry. The old tombs on the island still harbor some old relics of the blood. Recover these for me, and I will reward you.

If you want to know more about the Colovian traditions, don't forget to read the book I gave you.
###

> INFO.NAME pelladia ancestral relic 1856020982284543671
The Pelladia, like most other Colo-Nords, once buried their dead in Nordic style barrows. There are two of these on the island: the Chaerraich Barrow to the north of the town, and the Val Ansvech Barrow on the unsettled west side of the island. Here, take this book on the Colovian burial traditions. Perhaps it will prove useful.

You're here on behalf of Ledaia Pelladia? I think I can help you. While the Colo-Nordic nobility delights in ancient weapons, their true obsession is with blood. The blood of true saintly nobility is thought to be a special substance, capable of healing wounds or killing traitors -- in the Colovian myths, at least. At one point, it was customary to draw vials of blood from the bodies of dead saints and heroes of great renown. Finding such a relic is not easy these days, but it would serve your purpose.

Yes, Akaterina Hadrach is the Queen now. I can't help but wonder what happened to Herrius, though. If he ever does return to Anvil, he certainly won't be happy to see someone else in his place.
###

So you helped Akaterina Hadrach take the throne? Well, I certainly wish we could've gotten a member of the Order there instead.

Anyway, our new Queen should at least remember who helped her along, and take care to pay attention to their wishes.

Herrius wants us to kill Admiral Hasi? Well, I do have an idea for the way we could do it. I'll call him down here to this cabin for a meeting, and once he arrives, you'll ambush him. He won't be prepared for a fight, and I'll be able to dispose of the body easily. You and Herrius will have to act quickly after that, but with any luck, no one will realize Hasi's missing until Herrius is already on the throne.

Fine. If you must know, I have no plans to intervene if there is another coup attempt. I'm tired of this charade, and I'm not so attached to the Queen that I'd split the Navy apart for her. My orders to all our soldiers will be to remain neutral. But, as you're well aware, Admiral Hasi does not always listen to my orders. And he is awfully fond of the Queen. So he will very likely fight for her, and try to ensure that the coup fails.

So you killed one of Herrius' allies. In fact, you killed the person he specifically sent you to in order to figure out a way to kill Admiral Hasi. And then you returned to him, and told him that, and then he attacked you. I have to admit, I'm at something of a loss here. You're very probably the most stupid person I've ever met, and that's saying something. So, in acknowledgement of that, I'll give you a little advice. Get out of this manor. Get out of Anvil. Maybe get out of Cyrodiil. And never come back.

It seems that Admiral Hasi is the real problem once again. It is nice to have confirmation that the Navarch won't try to stop us, though. For now, go back to Herrius and tell him what you've learned.
###

> INFO.NAME resistance from the navy 7257277713012128680
Tiledorus Cadmerius did nothing when my father tried to take the throne. I don't think he'll be a problem. But maybe he's grown bolder in the last few years. And it never hurts to be safe.
###

> INFO.NAME resistance from the navy 1583455314516438
I'll get to the point. Admiral Hasi is going to be our main concern here, as he has proven himself willing to disobey orders to protect Queen Millona. That was what brought down my father and Olen Benirus. But I want to make sure that the Navy as a whole hasn't suddenly decided to support the Queen too. So I say you should go to Fort Telodrach and ask the Navarch, Tiledorus Cadmerius, what he plans to do about the coup, and pass what you learn to Herrius.

And you will never come back to this manor again, for duties or any other thing.

###

So the Navy is wise enough to stay out of our way, but Admiral Hasi is not. I suppose it's no surprise that he wants to keep playing his old role, but we simply cannot suffer his interference. He must die, and you will be the one to kill him. Return to Fort Telodrach and seek out Acylan Ulius, a Navy captain aboard the TEM Kintyra's Shield. He is an ally of mine, as well as a member of the Vampyrum Order, and he will have a plan to get rid of the Admiral.

I need you to ask nearby business owners to contribute to the cause. Obviously, the Hostel will take whatever it can get. But I personally believe 350 septims is a reasonable goal for you. It may seem ambitious, but I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by people's generosity if you ask around enough.
###

I'm sure you noticed the state of Little Arenthia on your way in, %PCRank. Those living here suffer from terrible poverty, and the Hostel of Saint Rosunius is one of the few ways they have of dealing with it. Unfortunately, the financial burden of the situation is taking its toll. I've been assisting as much as I can, but having someone go out to collect donations would be a big help.

###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 78696613024228160
Everything's clear to me, as if it happened only moments ago. The words on the page, the anticipation I felt as I read them, and the dread when the page disappeared and Barubi materialized. I'll write the invocation down for you. I don't know what'll happen if I say the words out loud again.
###

It's so frustrating. I've nearly got it all, but the final details escape me.
###

###

It's not all, but it's something. Perhaps it'll be of use?
###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 2281197263200513424
I can remember only part of the invocation, but I'll write it down for you. Best not let Barubi hear it before you're ready, eh?
###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 3824181853259218002
I don't think the potions have had much effect so far.
###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 52212029372239848
I'm really sorry I couldn't be of more use. My memory of that night is beyond hazy. Must have been the shock of seeing Barubi materialize before my eyes. Hopefully Daia has some trick up her sleeve to get me out of this mess. I hate to admit it, but she was right about my incompetence.
###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 2255130696176131417
Well, I'd come into posession of an old grimoire. Brown and with all sorts of illustrations of Daedra. A page came loose and fell out. On it was some sort of invocation. I read it out loud in my apartment, the words, one thing and then Barubi-something or other... I'm so sorry, %PCName, but I don't remember exactly. The paper turned to smoke, and then Barubi appeared. Gave me a mighty fright, I'm sure you understand. Sorry I couldn't help. If Daia's talking to you though, maybe she can recover the words.
###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 92951538717080869
I'm impressed. What you have recovered is a full and complete incantory neonymic. I know of very few mages that have ever managed that. This should allow you to alter the pact that binds Barubi to Vyric, and transfer it onto yourself. Still, I'm not sure how long such a bond would last for. It might be safer to instead dismiss the Guardian back to the void. Or, since you're proficient in Conjuration, perhaps you can use this opportunity to deconstruct the spell and learn something from it.
###

This should allow you to alter the pact that binds Barubi to Vyric, and transfer it onto yourself. Still, I'm not sure how long such a bond would last for. It might be safer to instead dismiss the Guardian back to the void. If you were more proficient in Conjuration, you might be able to deconstruct the spell and learn how to summon powerful Daedra, instead.
###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 1422200943095912412
While this isn't the complete invocation, it should still be sufficient to shatter the chains that bind Barubi to Vyric, and to banish Barubi back to the void. Perhaps there would be more you could do if you managed to reproduce the invocation in its entirity, but at the very least, the information you have now should allow you to free Vyric of his Guardian quickly and safely.
###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 296801394420363952
It seems you've recovered only one part of the Guardian's complete true name. That's still a powerful tool. Uttering it in the Guardian's presence will start to redirect the energies that bind it here, but unless you are able to reproduce the invocation to a fuller extent, the process will not be instantaneous. And the process will be highly unpleasant to Barubi, so be prepared to defend yourself while its chains are slowly loosened.
###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 16951224611650513366
I think procuring a potion of Fortify Willpower will be our best shot at this. If you find one, have Vyric drink it. That should jog his memory.
###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 296029240522230796
So that bumbling fool doesn't remember anything? I knew Vyric didn't have the wits to grasp advanced conjuration, but to think he is too feebleminded to recall simple information... I'm afraid that's a dead end. Unless... Yes, that might work. Go get a potion of Fortify Willpower. The stronger, the better. Perhaps that will give him the mental fortitude to plunge the murky depths of his memory.
###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 24568156521343027531
Get Vyric to tell you everything he knows about how Barubi ended up following him around.
###

> INFO.NAME reproduce the invocation 177009392266522241
If we could reproduce the invocation, you could command this 'Barubi' to go away and leave Vyric alone. At the very least, if you learn its true name, we can use it to our advantage when banishing it. Even knowing part of its true name might allow us to unspool the powers that bind it to this plane. Go back to Vyric, and have him tell you everything he knows about how this Guardian of his came into Mundus.

You've come to negotiate on the Fontanarius brothers' behalf? Then I'm afraid I'll have to decline whatever offer you intend to make.

Yes, that's right. It was my idea, actually. I was looking over some maps and it happened to occur to me that Akavir could be reached from the west just as well as the east. In fact, the western route could avoid all the dangers of the Padomaic Ocean and the Tsaesci, while still bringing in plenty of valuable Akaviri goods. Of course, finding the funds for it hasn't been easy, but I hope that the Director will agree to grant us a loan soon enough. You should speak to my brother if you want to help.

Claudius won, I lost, and if the Queen wants to show largesse, I'm a fool to reject it. I'll be off to Goldstone at once. You can have my shack, %PCName. I'm done here!

Yes, I love that idea. Really, the worst thing about Thresvy to me, more than wearing these rags, has been the boredom. I miss making deals, I miss the excitement, the adventure! Nothing happens here. Well, I've got nothing here worth taking with me, %PCName, so you can have my shack. I'll be out of here immediately to meet this Zanthus gentleman. Farewell!

Nito Nesba was a very rich man, one of Anvil's esteemed merchant princes. His family had accrued generations of wealth serving the crown... and I squandered it all. Drinks, drugs, vice, gambling. I blew through the whole inheritance and then some. Last I checked, I owe the Abecette 10,000 drakes. If I ever set foot in Anvil again, Raco Derrissa will have my head! And between you and me, I think that Redguard outside is one of his little bounty hunters. So I'm no longer Nito Nesba. I'm %Name.

Well, I do see half a dozen servants every day, you know... And my great-grandfather was a fisherman from Thresvy when his daughter joined the Navy. She bought a farm near the coast when she retired. Her son, my father, was the first in his family to benefit from higher education. He even went to the City to study the arcane arts! Thus I was given the chance to study in the Capital and apply to the Curia.

The enraged storm atronach should still be trapped in the western section of Anvil's Port Quarter sewers. Please go there and bring me back its soul. You'll need a great soul gem or better. There's a sewer entrance along the path west of here, near the Bendu Olo statue. Be careful while you're there -- you never know what unsavory characters you may find down there. And if you don't have a soul gem on you, our guild's enchanter, Marquand Lavalle, can sell you one. You'll find him on the second floor.

> INFO.NAME semi-stable summoning 1523627209207352155
I'm sure you're aware that any regular conjuration dissolves in a shower of golden sparkles eventually. That's unavoidable if all you invest is magicka, because magicka itself is unstable. A semi-stable summoning has no expiration date. But achieving that requires either a summoner of exceptional skill, a heavily enchanted anchor, or an incantory neonymic. And we can rule out the former two options on account of Vyric's incompetence.

Cyrodiil, the Imperial Province, is the largest province in the Empire, and the most important -- politically speaking, of course. By convention, Cyrodiil is composed of two halves. The eastern half, the Nibenay, is home to the jungled Niben Valley, uncountable rivers, and the isles of Cyrodiil City, the capital of the Empire. The western half, Colovia, is a mix of rugged highlands and fertile lowlands which extend as far west as the Abecean Sea.

Cyrodiil has more moths and butterflies than any other part of Tamriel, and their unique wings have useful alchemical properties. In Colovia, you may come across Drakewing, Fruitbearer, Red Fan, Ephialtic Nightkiss, or Blue Chalk butterflies. You can also find Arrow Moths, Rosy Moths, Cusp Moths, and Moon Moths, or even the occasional rare Ancestor Moth, which is held sacred. Butterflies usually fly in the daylight, and most moths don't come out until nighttime.

Pleasure doing business with you. Thresvy is where I'd start looking for nearby barrows. My sources in Anvil haven't found any boots in the tombs near the city, and I don't think they'd be farther inland. Darach Barrow is the closest one to Thresvy. It's a little ways southeast from there. There must be a pair of boots inside it, based on what I know. Also, take this potion just in case. I've found loot hidden in fairly high places.

Looking to find a pair? My suggestion is to check Darach Barrow near Thresvy. The Nedic port-cities of the Strident Coast were among the first settlements the Colo-Nords conquered during the Alessian Empire, and I expect one noble from that era was buried in that tomb. And hopefully with his boots. I don't know the precise location of the barrow, though. Try asking Cassanda in Charach if you need it.

Going tomb raiding, eh? I wouldn't know anything about the boots, unfortunately. But I can give you some general advice. Be careful when entering any barrow you come across. The undead are known to roam their halls. Don't let that put you off from exploring them, though. You can find some old but valuable loot inside those barrows.

They date back to the Alessian Empire, so you won't be able to obtain them just in any old shop. You'll have to search inside an old barrow. We've already checked the ones on Stirk Isle and couldn't find any. That leaves all the barrows remaining on the Strident Coast. Start searching for such boots in old barrows near Anvil or Thresvy. Maybe other guild members here could help you.

A savage bear has been attacking travelers on the road to Anvil. It's time to truly test your mettle, so I want you to take it down. The bear was last spotted along the Gold Road north of the city.

There haven't been any sightings of the beast near Fort Wavemoth or the Ayleid ruin, so it's probably not there.

Yes, a vampire. There was a stranger in the tavern. We started talking. Spent the whole night together, and drank a lot of liquor too. The next thing I know, I wake up here in my home with a splitting headache, and I'm spitting blood. This is vampirism! The symptoms match up! And I'm sure that cursed High Elf gave it to me. I can see that you're not afraid of vampires. Otherwise you would've run away already. Can you find that monster for me and force him to undo my curse?

I do apologize, but that won't be possible. This temple is a small one, and while I miss Vurila's company sometimes, having the two of us here was already straining the chapel's capacity. Bringing in two more people with me, one of whom is a minotaur, would just be too much. You could ask at the Chapel of Solemn Echoes, though. It's outside the city walls, in the graveyard just north of the Gold Road's end, and it only has one priest right now. She might be looking for help.

Now that you mention it, maybe I should ask for a raise.

Yes, I'm the artist who created 'Triumph of Pelinal' on commission for Lord Theophon Ivrol. Despite the name, it's actually a portrait of Theophon himself, done in the style of Pelinal after his triumph at Sancre Tor. This is quite common for noble clients. I hope you can get this sorted out without too much fuss. Theophon is a good man, but he can be short-tempered. His father is more patient, and I'm sure Theophon will become the same in time.

I know the situation of which you speak. Officially, the Conservatory of Saint Laeca has nothing but respect for the esteemed and inestimable Ivrol Family.

We are planning to set sail on a voyage soon. It's to keep up appearances with the locals that we import goods from Hammerfell. I have already drafted the contract with Bal to guarantee safe passage of our ship over the open seas. What I want you to do is find Arthi, the ritual sacrifice I named in the contract. He's a destitute beggar in Little Arenthia. Lure him to our shrine in The Scupper, whether by will or by force, and I will induct you into our cult and reward you appropriately. What do you say?

Unfortunately, yes. But I couldn't handle the cult's activities anymore, so I left soon after we arrived here. The cult let me, thankfully, since I told Kyrana Quina that I would join the West Navy and try to get others into the cult. However, I can assure you I have not done any such thing, and I don't plan to!
###

> INFO.NAME placid drowner cult 3202121243167133297
So did we. Anyway, in addition to our usual trading, our ship soon afterwards started offering the cult's services to other ships to ensure their own safety at sea, or to upend their rivals' or enemies' ships. We continued to do so long after the uprising was quelled, until our ship arrived back to the port of Anvil a couple of months ago to resupply.
###

> INFO.BNAM placid drowner cult 3202121243167133297 c1
Is the cult still performing their services here?
###

> INFO.NAME placid drowner cult 21656247569311514
As the days progressed, the storms started to come back. Some of us took it as a sign we needed to become more extreme, offering sacrifices of man and mer to please Bal to ensure our ship's safety. The storms stopped soon after, so we were convinced it worked. After that, Kyrana initiated willing crewmembers into the cult, until eventually all of the crew members including myself were indoctrinated.
###

> INFO.BNAM placid drowner cult 21656247569311514 c1
I see.
###

> INFO.NAME placid drowner cult 201132682062256298
Yes. Kyrana showed us how to make Drowner contracts to the Watcher before our voyages, including the offerings we needed. We would throw some grain, meat, gold, or blood in the water, anoint the offerings with the blood of gutted fish, and then we'd drown them in the sea. The sacrifices seemed harmless at the time, just some birds or other animals nobody cared about. It seemed to have worked, as the storms lessened initially.
###

What happened then?
###

> INFO.NAME placid drowner cult 25585764351979876
Before I joined the Navy, I used to be a crew member of a tradeship called Brine Stone back during the Soulrest Uprising. At the time, we were trying to deliver imported goods to support the Navy soldiers, and there were many storms along the way that nearly upended our ship. One day, a mystic in our crew, Kyrana Quina, said that the storms could be stopped if we made sacrifices to the Watcher of the waves, Molag Bal. We were afraid, so we listened.
###

Yes, I heard the rumors about victims found drowned in the harbor. Some of the sailors here have been a little shaken up by it.

The Navy sailor who found the contract said they happened to see it in the water near the fort. I'm guessing that someone in Fort Telodrach tried to hide the contract by throwing it into the sea.

While the Legion and West Navy were deployed to Soulrest to quell the rebellion, some of the sailors picked up the cult's traditions and brought them back to Cyrodiil. Until now I had thought that the cult was elsewhere, outside of Anvil. But lately there's been rumors of people and animals being found drowned in the harbor, and after seeing that Drowner contract, I'm starting to worry I was wrong. I believe the cult has a base here in Anvil, and I want you to investigate it.

Here is the key. I want you to escort our guests, Varadrin Nyla and Veradhel Nyla, to the Sacred Baths. You can access the Baths from the Frigidarium. When you're there, bring the pilgrims to Lessi Hecaria, the Theurgist. I'll let her know to expect you. She will help our guests complete the consummation ritual. After you have brought them to Lessi, bring back the key I gave you immediately. You understand all of this, right?

So I'll give you an honor normally reserved only for our favored worshippers and prominent patrons -- I'll permit you to see the Sacred Baths.

He commands the Imperial Navy on our side of Tamriel from Fort Telodrach. To get there, just take a ship from the docks to Anvil and head west until you hit the fort. To be honest, I don't expect him to pay my petition much mind. He wouldn't have mothballed Duskwatch Keep in the first place if he was going to.

Thank you. Here, a bit more coin for your work finding the keystone. I believe this one unlocks the Dorahame section of the ruins, based on the markings along the side. I'd bet my left eye that the keystone that unlocks the ruin's final section, Malatu Mallari, is in there somewhere. There will be a hefty coinpurse waiting for you if you return with it.

It's not much at the moment, but that's to be expected. She hasn't fully bought into the scam. But the fact that she's invested at all means she's interested, and that gives us an opportunity. While her attention is still focused on the stock, we're going to pump it to the point where she'll feel like she can't afford to miss out. When she jumps in again, it'll be with half the money in Goldstone's vault.

The Kingdom of Sarchal is the poorest of Colovia's eight kingdoms, and the most isolated.

One of the Company's ships that left from Anvil after Navy patrols were suspended has gone missing, and is presumably wrecked.

We haven't had the resources to do so yet, but it shouldn't be hard for someone well-equipped like you to look into it. Find the wreck and bring me the ship's logbook. Its route took it near the White Reef, by the Viduscan Isles southeast of Stirk, so start looking there.

You're clearly a woman of action, so I'll use small words. Daedra's true names hold power over their subjects. A skilled mage can fashion a name into an invocation, which may bind, control, or kill the Daedroth. And invocations can be written down and passed on. Vyric may have stumbled across a tome or scroll holding such an invocation, calling his Guardian to this plane and tenuously binding it to him. If you can reproduce the invocation, you might be able to take over the reins, so to speak.

After Solvus told me your findings, I had scouts approach it on the suspicion that he would plan something there. They saw a small army of mercenaries patrolling inside, and I'm sure that their master has now arrived. Go there, strike at him, and end this insanity.

Lavus has no connection to the previous coup, but he's one of the Legion's ranking officers in Anvil. If Herrius can sway the military to his side, and, as you discovered, has a real claim to the title of Shore-King, then many more would be deluded into supporting him.

Our Home here relies on them as the only source of money needed for its continuous survival. Thankfully, we are in the middle of the Abecean Sea, and local captains consider it virtuous to spend their hard-earned money on charitable endeavors. What I need you to do is go to Anvil, visit one of those captains, Urri the Red, and ask her for a donation. 1500 septims should be about enough.

A noble order, to be sure. Wandering the roads, offering comfort and guidance. Admirable, really. But tell me, how much do they truly uncover in their endless travels? Sometimes, friend, the greatest truths are found not in far-off places, but right under our noses. Perhaps there's more to see, if you're willing to look beyond the familiar teachings. A blessing, especially from one touched by Zenithar's favor, could open the way to golden truths.

The Itinerant Priests are a network of priests, monks, pilgrims, sages, and clerics. Some say we're social misfits, cult order drop-outs, or sinners in search of redemption. Maybe there's some truth to that, but we're also adventurers devoted to helping others, wanderers in search of spiritual insight, or wise elders who prefer to spend their last years on the open roads. All of us are looking to understand our place in the world, and as part of that goal we look to undertake spiritually fulfilling works.

I keep telling him it's not necessary, but he just won't listen. I think he's trying to get in our good graces so that we'll fund his little chaplaincy over at Fort Telodrach.

Either way, I have more duties for you.

Solving this problem quickly is crucial, %pcrank. We can't allow these rumors to spread any further than they already have. It could easily lead to panic and chaos among other farmers, which would severely impact the Kingdom's standing. The impact, of course, would be even worse if the curse actually exists, so get on it.

The ranch's owner, Rycius Ossius, has been flooding me with letters about a curse supposedly destroying his livelihood. He asks for the Kingdom's assistance with the matter. Even if there is no curse, which I think is the case, you should still go there and check in with him, if only to show that the %faction cares about its citizens' concerns. Ossius Ranch is located to the east of Anvil, just beyond its walls.

###

Necromancers defiling a crypt? That surely must have been the source of the curse. Divines must have been punishing us for not intervening and safeguarding the nobles' remains. Thank you for putting an end to this unholy business. You know what? I can't let you go empty-handed. You should take some of this ranch's very own meat and cheese for your hard work.

Thank the Nine, they finally sent someone to deal with our plight. I'm sure you think I'm going crazy or I'm too lazy to work, but the curse is real. Did you see my four cows? I used to have six and some goats, but they all died. And the symptoms they had! I've never seen anything that vile. You should look around the ranch. Maybe you can find something that we haven't. And one more thing: don't bother talking to my ranch hand, Mudahvi. I think the stress is making her imagine things.

Do you have a license? May I see it? Ah, so you're from Fort Heath. How's Durcanius doing? I haven't heard from him in a while. I presume he needs more flashgrit for the mine, yes? Unfortunately, I can't spare more than eight canisters for the Legion at the moment. I have to ration my stock for other entities. But you're free to buy whatever I have available for you now. I'll keep it on hand for you in case you don't need it all at once. And when you do go back to the fort, please give Durcanius my regards.

As I've already told you, the Legion has a mine near Fort Heath in which they've been using flashgrit to expand their operation. They have a license from the So-Mitana Company for it. K'Raskha in Anvil could forge a copy of their license for you. Just hand him that blank license I gave you to work from. If you show the forged license to Harrold and pretend you're there to buy more flashgrit for the Legion, he'll sell you some without question.
###

I know an accountant, K'Raskha, who works in Anvil's East Empire Company warehouse in Anvil's Garden Quarter. He runs a forgery business on the side. He can forge a copy of the Legion's license for you. He's not as good as Old Man Theft, but if you give him something to work from he'll be fine. Besides, I'd rather not get the Arenthian involved. Here, take this. It's a blank flashgrit license. I got it from a company informant of mine in Hammerfell. Just give him that to use, and he'll get the job done.

Wise choice. The Imperial Legion has a mine near Fort Heath. They've been using flashgrit to expand their operation. They have a license from the So-Mitana Company for it. I don't know where they keep it, but even if I did, Harrold wouldn't accept it if he found out it was stolen. Your best bet would be to forge their license and show that to Harrold instead. He wouldn't be able to tell the difference. He'd gladly sell you flashgrit if you pretend you're buying for the Legion.

Harrold, the So-Mitana Company representative in town, won't sell flashgrit to anyone without a license. But if you show him you have one, he won't give you any trouble. He'll sell you some flashgrit without question. If you're interested, I have some information about where you can get a license. I'll tell you more about it for, hmm, how about 750 drakes?

The So-Mitana Company licenses flashgrit out to militias, mining operations, other companies, and the Hammerfell kingdoms. If you manage to get your hands on one of those licenses, you might be able to convince the representative of the company in Charach to sell a few canisters to you freely. Maybe Cassanda will know where you could steal or forge one?

Of course, %PCName. Anything to help %Name's old friend Lysandra. Now, let %Name see... A 'love potion', you say? Truth be told, it's more akin to a Drain Personality potion, albeit a rather poor attempt at one. Given its extraordinarily poor quality, %Name can't guarantee any effect it might have. In all likelihood, it's just as likely to make the drinker quite sick and miserable as anything else. That so-called 'charisma potion' at least, is entirely harmless -- though equally ineffectual.

Love potions? *sigh*...Okay. We need to make sure these potions are safe. To accomplish that, we need an alchemist to inspect them. But given what occurred with Ugenring's bouquet, I'd rather not risk doing so myself. A friend of mine in the Anvil guildhall, Dra'Tahn, would be able to make sure they're safe, if you could find a way to take them to her. Perhaps offer to take his potions to Anvil in order to 'fortify' them, in order to boost his chances. I'm sure he'll hand them straight over.

Yes, specifically from Ugenring, that Bosmer who lives down by the docks. Initially, I might have found his efforts almost endearing -- almost.

It sunk northeast of Charach, and just east of Elcid Islet. I know from surviving sailors that two particular items should still be on board: a silver goblet that belonged to an influential Hierophant, and the ship's logbook. I suspect that Caperno was using the Emperor Cassynder for smuggling. Even though I've offered to help him retrieve cargo from the wreck, he's been adamant that we'd find nothing of value. I think he wants to avoid an investigation. Keep your eyes open for signs of contraband.

Several of Marav's farmers have trapped their Reeve, Keitius Nobius, in his home. They say it's a response to our increasing imports of saltrice from Morrowind. It's extremely cheap -- no doubt due to using slave labor -- and as a result, the prices of other crops have dropped to compete with it. The farmers asked to speak with a representative of the Kingdom, so I'm sending you. Make sure Keitius is alright and resolve the situation peacefully. I don't want blood on either of our hands.

Are you a fan of fine art, %PCName? A noble named Aurenius Aceli is, and he's in town to make a special purchase. He bought a painting called 'Divine Impresence', and it's currently being prepared for delivery in the Goldstone Gallery Tower. Which is where you come in. If you can steal the painting, YOU can be the one to deliver it to him at the All Flags Inn -- and charge whatever you want for the convenience. Good luck.

It's good that you freed Bernd, but I have some bad news. It seems that Kyro knew his connections had been discovered, and burned down the Conina farmhouse before we had a chance to apprehend him. He then fled, and now we don't know where he is. Take these as a reward for your work, but speak with me again as soon as you can to assist with your next duties. This crime cannot go unpunished.
###

###

So he really was innocent the whole time, and Jafan was lying about all of it? He must have let himself be captured so that he could feed false information to us... Well, I feel that Bernd is owed an apology, then, but I'm sure he'd appreciate the more concrete gesture of freeing him from jail. Go to the guardhouse, have him released, and come back to me afterwards so that we can discuss how to deal with Kyro Gavus. And good work getting the truth out of Jafan, %PCName.
###

###

> INFO.NAME bernd is innocent 274627907162116328
Nessa has claimed that this whole affair is a misunderstanding, or even a deliberate act of framing. She says that Bernd isn't a smuggler, and only resisted arrest because he was scared of going to jail. I'm not sure if I really believe her, but I'd at least like you to look into this and see if there's any evidence for her claims. I'd recommend tracking down Jafan in Anvil and questioning him again -- maybe in a louder voice, maybe intimidating him a bit -- to see if he left anything out before.
###

> INFO.NAME bernd is innocent 29185989531714875
Bernd really hasn't been able to provide any information about the smugglers' operations, and it doesn't seem to be out of some exceptional reticence. That alone certainly isn't enough to free him, but I think that the situation is worth investigating, and I want you to find some definitive evidence for or against his story. I'd recommend tracking down Jafan in Anvil and questioning him again -- maybe in a louder voice, maybe intimidating him a bit -- to see if he left anything out before.

To enchant an item, you must have a filled soul gem, as well as knowledge of the magic you want to imbue. Different items have different capacities for enchantments, and the various soul gems can contain more or less powerful souls. Strong souls allow for more and stronger magical effects. Since failure destroys the filled soul gem, creating enchantments yourself carries a significant risk. This can be avoided by visiting a professional enchanter -- who will charge handsomely for the service, though.

My true name is Urac Vernitus. I am the last of the Shore-Kings, and the crown is mine by right of blood. When the despicable Sload sent a plague to destroy all Tamriel, I was nearly swept along by that dead tide. But I had planned a way to preserve the royal line -- joining the Vampyrum Order. My contact turned me, though I was already close to death; I fell into a deep slumber, waking once more only when Anvil was razed in fire. So I ask: will you join your rightful King and overthrow the false Queen?

It is wise, to seek more knowledge in return for sharing your own. I might withhold my intentions from you were things otherwise, but the time for caution is past. I mean to depose Millona by force, and become King myself. I will unify our divided institutions, practice true diplomacy with our neighbors, and rule the people of Anvil with a firm hand where that of Cyrodiil City has sadly grown weak. The Queen knows of this, but she is powerless to stop it. For I have one other thing that she does not.

How interesting. You would serve this Kingdom, then, but are loyal to its ruler alone? %PCRank, you would do well to remember that the so-called Queen is illegitimate -- merely a simple schemer who found her way to power and latched onto it for dear life. Likely a murderer, too; Claudius' disappearance could be no accident. If you truly wish to fulfill your oath, then you would show your loyalty to me. For I have one other thing that Millona will never possess.

You doubt my intentions? I understand. Millona and her underlings have taught you that I am to be hated and feared. They never would have said much about the Queen's preferences towards a certain Redguard admiral, though, or that princess who defiles the holy name of Al-Esh. After all, if she did not hold attachment to Claudius, and killing him off would simply let her claim the throne, then who is to say that she did not? If this talk still does not convince you, though, allow me to say one more thing.

You can see further than most. Perhaps you have played witness to these wrongs yourself, in your previous duties to the Kingdom. It is well that they be ended by another who cares for Anvil's people. And they shall certainly end, for I have one more thing that Millona does not.

Under her rule, relations with Sutch, our closest neighbor, have only deteriorated. She refuses to treat them with proper respect merely because of the rumors and fears surrounding their late King. The Navy, too, has been paralyzed by factionalism; she has dealt a blow to the very foundations of Empire! And worst of all, she has no legitimate claim to the throne. King Claudius might have, but he is gone. And his loyal wife seems to care not a whit about him but for the power he brought. Would you not agree?

I will speak plainly: the Kingdom is suffering under the rule of its pretender Queen Millona. She claims to care about the people, but you must not be fooled. Many lies and half-truths have mingled in her mouth, and these are but more among them. All her actions are simply meant to keep her on the throne, no matter the cost to anyone else.

The largest of the Colovian kingdoms, Anvil rules the Strident Coast, the southern reaches of the Brennan Bluffs, the western Dasek Marsh, and the myriad isles of the inner Abecean Sea, including Stirk Isle. Blessed with fair climate, fertile soils, and a key position at the terminus of the Gold Road, the realm is also the wealthiest of all Colovia's kingdoms. By tradition, the Oloman noble families of Anvil bid for the throne in a grand ceremony for the benefit of the Red Treasury.

I had my eye on that amulet for some time. As I am self-employed, I think it's not unreasonable to treat myself once in a while, and it seemed the perfect item. The one complication, however, is that the shop's proprietor, Isel Sard-Hand, simply refuses to trade with gremlins. When I so much as approached her, she shouted at me and had me rather unceremoniously removed from the premises. I suspect she'll be more accomodating with you, so I'd like you to take this gold and purchase the amulet yourself.

Agha Fimmion sent you to find him? Thank you for helping us. Huurvan would regularly go on hunting trips with mer outside the tribe, so we Srethuunu wouldn't know where he went. Maybe check the Sailor's Fluke in Little Arenthia? I've heard a hunter frequents the place. Or if not, there should be some scouts you could talk to in the Census and Excise Office in the Marina. Maybe they know something.

Thank you, %PCClass. We Bosmer practice our ancestor worship differently than the Altmer and Dunmer. One of those practices includes carrying around trinkets of tribal or familial ancestor bones. The bones allow us to be with our ancestors at all times. This amulet was made from the bones of my grandmother, Arwaen. She was a tribeless widow who fought the Usurper's hordes towards the end of her life. Upon Haymon's defeat, her actions granted her the rare honor of a selection of tribes, including Valeglenh.

Yes, I know him well. He used to be my student. You're saying he's been missing for some time? That really worries me. I don't know where he is now, but I know he liked to go hunting east of the city in Aurum Grove. It's a small grove just southwest of Fort Heath. He'd regularly go hunting there with his Altmer friend, Moredinir. She has a camp near the grove, a little to the south of the signposted area before where the road splits off near the fort. She may have seen him recently.

The one you have is just a copy of an old contract back at sea, before we became more extreme. Kyrana gave that to me when I left for recruiting purposes. I was to secretly distribute it as an invitation to potential recruits I thought would be open to join the cult.

During the uprising, certain Nibenese sailor folklore had spread among the South Navy that Molag Bal, lord of the deep ocean, must be placated with sacrifice. Believers would create contracts such as the one I gave you, and they'd ritually drown their victims in honor of Bal. A Daedric cult was formed revolving around this tradition, and its cultists began maintaining secret shrines in port cities and aboard ships. The cult's drowning practices were so common that it became known as the Placid Drowner Cult.

You convinced Lusha? Great. Now go back to Straler and ask if he needs you to do anything else.
###

> INFO.NAME set up a meeting 67291519923634214
He asked you to retrieve drugs? What for? You know what? It doesn't matter. If you think it should be done, do it. There's a guard posted outside his apartment, but if you show her that warrant, she should let you in.
###

> INFO.NAME set up a meeting 325467834367926242
Conducting the meeting in the usual place is another good suggestion from Straler. So far, every single one of his ideas has been good, and it makes me angry. With his intellect, he could have become someone useful, like an educator, but instead he chose to make drugs. Whatever. What's done is done. Let's focus on the task at hand. Convincing this Lusha shouldn't be too hard, especially with that warrant that I gave you.
###

> INFO.BNAM set up a meeting 325467834367926242 c1
He also asked me to recover drugs from his apartment.
###

> INFO.NAME set up a meeting 8277228451598829246
I gave you all the information that I have. All the information you need to put Za'Rabi behind bars. The plan has been drafted, and now is the time for you to execute it.
###

> INFO.NAME set up a meeting 2926630151254016682
Then the meeting can go ahead. My distributor is a Khajiit named Za'Rabi. I've thought for a long time about how best to trap him, and here's what I came up with. You need to have a guard stationed in the pawn shop before the two of you arrive. He's a slippery cat, and that way you can ensure he has no way out. Once the guard is in place, go to the Abecette, a hotel in the Garden Quarter, and pay Za'Rabi a visit. If you give him a taste of my new batch, he'll follow you anywhere.
###

> INFO.NAME set up a meeting 7303252642059222659
It's crucial that you have a bottle for the distributor. He always requests to try the produce before buying it. If you ask me, that's very irresponsible. Goes against my mantra. Only sell it. Never use it. Fewer problems that way.
###

> INFO.NAME set up a meeting 10317113182069410103
You convinced Lusha? Excellent. Do you have a bottle from my latest batch?
###

> INFO.BNAM set up a meeting 10317113182069410103 c1
Yes.
###

> INFO.BNAM set up a meeting 10317113182069410103 c2
No.
###

Lusha isn't a good person. But she's not a bad person, either. She allowed me to move product in her pawn shop, but that's just because I paid her a sizable sum each time. Our dealings were purely transactional, and I advise you to follow my example. If she refuses to budge, try to sweeten her up with some coin. Or just threaten her with jail time. It's your choice.
###

That's good, but it will be of no use to us if you can't convince Lusha. She isn't a good person. But she's not a bad person, either.

###

> INFO.NAME set up a meeting 1437816644764717583
Have you convinced Lusha to let you set up a meeting?
###

> INFO.BNAM set up a meeting 1437816644764717583 c1
No, but I found a skooma bottle from your hidden lab.
###

> INFO.BNAM set up a meeting 1437816644764717583 c2
No.
###

> INFO.NAME set up a meeting 254013462725010983
The second thing I need you to do is to bring back one bottle of my newest batch from my hidden lab. Don't worry, it's not for me. It's for the distributor to taste when you meet him. You'll have to convince him that it was me who sent you, and there's no better way to do it than to come with my product in hand. My lab is in my apartment, in the North Wall Apartments complex in Little Arenthia. It's not far from Lusha's shop. The key to the lab is under my pillow.
###

> INFO.NAME set up a meeting 12200117391507010662
I'm not a fool, so I'm not going to ask you to release me before the distributor is arrested. But in order for that meeting to happen, I need two things from you. The first is to secure the meeting's location. I couldn't just sell the produce at my house. That's too conspicuous. Instead, I utilized the backrooms of the pawn shop in Little Arenthia, so gracefully provided by its owner, Lusha. You should convince her to let you use it for another deal.

I don't want any trouble! I'll tell you everything. This creepy Imperial was paying me to use the backrooms in off-work hours. How was I supposed to know that he was selling drugs there? Oh, but I should have known! I can cooperate. A representative of our esteemed Queen may, of course, use my shop for whatever purposes they might need. I'll prepare the room with the fireplace for your arrival.
###

> INFO.NAME set up a meeting 8666172642297413791
Are you serious? Why would Straler send someone instead of coming on his own? Whatever. You can tell him that, as usual, the room with the fireplace will be ready for his arrival. Oh, and that he should pay me extra this time for sending a stranger without a warning.
###

I'm afraid your signature would not be enough for such a sizable loan. In our dealings with the Marshal, we've found that his promises can be... ephemeral, at times. As such, we would require any co-signer of his to be reputable enough that we wouldn't foresee any issues with repayment. I'm sure you understand.

Ordinarily, we would be happy to provide Marshal Halgern with a loan. But as a result of a few unfortunate incidents in his repayment history, we must insist on some additional security. For a loan of 2500 septims, we would either need commensurate collateral -- to be held by us and returned upon complete repayment of the loan -- or a trustworthy co-signer.

That Nibenese fellow was good. Really good. We couldn't win a single nine-holes game against him. No, I don't think he cheated. Maybe Hora favored him, I don't know. But he kept winning. And we kept throwing drakes in the game to try and get it all back. It didn't work. We lost several hundred septims between the three of us that night. I was really mad by then. I made one last effort to try and win it all back -- I bet my lucky amulet. That was a big mistake, as you can see. I wish I could take it back.

A century ago, after the realm was ravaged by the armies of the Camoran Usurper, Sutch was annexed to the Imperial Province, restoring its ancient status as a Colovian Estate. Though it was historically little more than an impoverished frontier fiefdom, the modern Kingdom of Sutch has competently leveraged its location and its valuable salt and stone resources to become a hub of trade and pilgrimage.

%Name doesn't know whence the pirates bothering the fishermen in Thresvy come, but %Name is sure they're not operating between Thresvy and the mouth of the Naharine River, south of here. There are isolated fishermen living north of Thresvy -- they're wary of strangers, but maybe they saw something. Their huts are located on the coast, between Old Thraswatch and the ruins of Garlas Malatar.

###

Yeah, we've got a few of those. I'm not sure what to tell you. It's possible there's pirate activity around Thresvy, but I'm fairly positive they're not operating from around here. You can always ask Pintra, upstairs. She's our scout. She knows the coastline in and out.
###

Yes. That's what pirates usually do. Talk to Kostanz if you have something important to ask, or to report, but please don't waste the man's time with drivel. I'm going to get yelled at if you do.
###

###

> INFO.NAME thieving pirates 4042136918320188
I might know a place where they could be hiding. It's a secluded beach, with a grotto called Stonehead Cave. Head north from here along the water. You'll soon reach two shacks -- no, those aren't the pirates either. Follow the beach further until cliffs block your path. From there, swim close to the shore until you reach a small, hidden beach. Pass under the rock arch, and you'll be at Stonehead Cave.

I got a good look at one of their boats once. It looked heavy in the water. They were going north. Now, there's no way to be sure, but I reckon they were sailing back to their hideout after a night of plunder. There are fishermen living in two lone shacks on the coast north of Thresvy. Karam and Elendroth. Can't say I like them, but maybe they've got an idea where the pirates are holed up. To reach them, just continue north up the beach.

We don't actually want Cassandra. We want her boss, Lessi Hecaria. She's one of the most powerful people in the Temple of Dibella Estetica, and a big fan of the finer things this world has to offer. But Lessi is hard to get in contact with, so the idea is to get to her through Cassandra. Bring her a shiny piece of glass, tell her there could be more to come, and she'll be all over us. Oh, and in case you've never been there, the Temple is the centerpiece of the Garden Quarter.

The Queen believes it unwise to reject his appeal outright. If one of Anvil's nobles were to make a statement by offering the donation in her stead, it would undermine her political position. It would be ideal if you were to make this donation on her behalf, instead. As an aside, you may find it interesting that Thimistrel Manor's tower is said to contain Herrius Thimistrel's considerable fortune. When you have the money, however you obtain it, Sirethal is waiting on the balcony just above us.

Sirethal comes as a diplomat of Woodhearth, a city in Valenwood which was nearly razed to the ground during the War of the Blue Divide. That was thirty years ago, but reconstruction has been slow, and he's asked for a donation of 3000 septims to help speed things along. The Queen would like some time to deliberate on the merits of such a large gift, but Sirethal has been... impatient.

She's dead? How could you botch this? You were supposed to break her out of Goldstone alive! *Sigh* I'm sorry. A thief must be level-headed, even at times like this. I'm sure her death wasn't in your control. I'll still give you another job, %PCRank, but you better not bungle this one up as well.

Thanks for getting her out of Goldstone. It's good to have our pawnbroker back. Here, please take this amulet as a reward. It used to belong to an old Nibenese thief I knew. It served her well for a while. Hopefully you'll fare better with it.

She got caught trying to steal something and was imprisoned for it in Goldstone. Unfortunately, Anvil's under the Arenthian's purview, and by his decree, we're forbidden from attempting any heists there. So you can bet we'll receive no help from him. However, he didn't say anything about jailbreaks. So that's what I want you to do. Go and break her out of there.

Dibella, the Goddess of Beauty, has nearly a dozen different cults devoted to different aspects of the deity. Some are devoted to women, some to artists and aesthetics, and others to erotic instruction. These sub-cults all fall within one of two factions -- traditional hedonists and modern ascetics. Currently, the cult is preoccupied with a power struggle between the old, hedonistic interpretation of Dibella, and new leadership which emphasizes the modern ideal of ascetic, perfect beauty.

Yes, this is my estate. We're standing in the meeting room I'm using for my official activities as Reeve of Thresvy. Next door is the distillery, where we make aliyew and kurst. Also within the estate's walls, you'll find the manor and the orchard. The apple trees allow us to be our own suppliers for the distillery, which is a necessity considering how isolated we are from any significant trade route. Outside, to the east, there's the family crypt, just across the road from the durata fields.
###

> INFO.NAME lacorius estate 2486223152851515371
The estate is older than Thresvy itself! The Lacorius family belongs to the kingdom's old nobility, back when the Colovian knights, as retainers of the kings, protected the farms and herds against the dangers that scoured the land. Our estate was then already on the outskirts of a village centered on the tower of Old Thraswatch. When it was rebuilt by my ancestors, it led the exiled villagers to settle the coast again, drawn by the safety of our walls and the dynamism of our business. Like in the old days.

It's right next to the village, to the northeast. It's composed of orchards, a manor, a crypt, and of course the distillery, surrounded by walls. Sometimes, when there's a peak in activity at the distillery or in the fields, half the village can be found working on the estate. Especially when fishing is slow.

The smithy would be the most expensive room to furnish. You'd want an anvil for forging and hammering and a sturdy table for works-in-progress. Storage space is a must.

Hmm. I was correct. This wasn't a typical crypt robbery. It's not common knowledge, but the southeastern chamber of Conomorus Crypt was being reserved for King Claudius. Whoever wrote this letter must be suspicious that he was secretly interred there.

Conomorus Crypt is located in the graveyard just north of Anvil. To get there, exit from the city's northeastern gate and follow the wall west. I recommend caution once you're inside. We have no idea what the intruders are capable of.
###

The guards seem convinced that this is a standard crypt robbery, but I have my doubts. Conomorus Crypt is nearly barren of valuables. It is, however, the future resting place of Queen Millona, leading me to believe this is some kind of statement against her. Make your way to the crypt as soon as possible. To get there, exit from the city's northeastern gate and follow the wall west until you reach the graveyard. Deal with the intruders as you see fit, and discover what you can about their motive.

We need to figure out who's spreading these rumors and why. Talk with Latreus Aurantus, the guild alchemist, to see if he knows what this is all about. Then use whatever he can tell you to track down the person responsible. Remember, we do NOT want to antagonize our clientele, so be sure to handle this with discretion.

This guild hall makes almost all of its revenue from selling potions and enchantments to adventurers passing through. If we get a reputation for poor-quality goods, business will dry up. And that means meddling from Kvatch. Talk with Latreus Aurantus, the guild alchemist, to see if he remembers any upset customers. Find the problem and stop these rumors, but keep in mind we can't afford any more controversy. I expect you to handle this with the utmost discretion.

Oh, I remember now. Boldarus was desperate for some potions, and I told him I was nearly out. He claimed he just needed a few to prove... something. I can't remember what. Anyway, he said he would take anything. I told him I did have some old potions that I was about to throw out because they were close to spoiling. I warned him to use them quickly and only charged him a pittance. If they caused him trouble, that's not our fault. Maybe someone at the inn can help you deal with him?
###

It's an absurd accusation. Potion spoilage is unavoidable, but I am more than capable of keeping track of our stock, and I'd never sell anything at risk of going bad without giving notice. That said, I really don't know who could be responsible for the rumors. It has to be someone in town, though. Ask around at the Crossing Inn. That's where travelers usually stay.

I like you, %PCClass, so I'll give you the details. Boldarus came in here pretty scraped up a while ago. He claimed he'd been out exploring and ran into a bit of trouble. He drank some potions from the Mages Guild, but instead of giving him strength, they drained it. According to him, he dropped his family sword in the scuffle and ran straight here.

###

I object to the term 'dispute'. It's a payment demand for services the Colovian Wagoners Association deliberately sabotaged. Are you aware that my last two shipments of aliyew were completely ruined when they arrived at their destinations? The buyers were forced to make another purchase -- from Sigorn Lacorius. If it had happened once, I would've chalked it up to simple bad luck. But twice is a pattern. They won't be getting any of my money.

So you and Calmanwe managed to clear out those goblins and bind the Daedric guardian? Not only that, but you also had that little talk with her that I asked of you? Great work, %PCName! As I said, I owe you one. For now, perhaps this soul gem will suffice as a token of my appreciation.

There's an entrance to it in a hill east of Wormusoel. Go there with Calmanwe, clear the cave of goblins, and use the scroll I gave you to summon the Daedric guardian for her.
###

> INFO.NAME kingfisher cave 12058232192954328170
The cave itself is on the north side of the island, on the hillside east of Wormusoel. There's another High Elf camped in a smaller Ayleid ruin north of Charach, so perhaps she can offer more specific directions. Calmanwe should still be in the Aquamarine Suite at the Sunset Hotel, so speak to her there before making your way to the cave. By the way, I also have an informal duty to ask of you.
###

> INFO.NAME kingfisher cave 21173710929467613
We've been hired to clear out the cave once again, but this time we'll deploy a permanent Daedric presence to deter any further incursions. Permanent summons are exceptionally difficult and time-consuming, of course, so Calmanwe will assist in that regard. Take this scroll; she will bind the Daedra permanently once you've summoned it. The enchantment will only function inside the cave, and only once it detects no remaining goblins.

Yes, Kingfisher Cave. The Kingdom's guards recently drove them off, but the vermin returned almost immediately. Worse still, they belong to the so-called Wave Reaver tribe -- seafaring pirates, if you can believe it. Historically, these 'Wave Reavers' have given Stirk a wide berth due to the Navy, but since the closure of Duskwatch Keep, they've grown much bolder.

###

It's a cave north of Charach, roughly halfway between the ruins of Wormusoel and the eastern shore. Prepare for a bit of a hike if you're headed there.

Strident runners are large, flightless predatory birds that inhabit the flat southern parts of Colovia. Runners are very territorial, and fight viciously to protect their nests. With few natural predators, runners sometimes need to be culled in large numbers by the Colovian kingdoms lest they overrun ranches and farms. Their distinctive honking call is a familiar -- and quite often annoying -- sound to anyone living near strident runner nesting grounds.

I have been informed that she is in town, yes. I know of the Pelladia family, of course, but only through historical records. They have not lived on Stirk Isle during my own lifetime, much less during my tenure as Marshal of the Isles. In either case, I've seen no need to intervene thus far. We face more pressing issues than some old woman who thinks that her long-gone family should still hold sway in Charach.

I am happy that she is doing well for herself, but this quest of hers is foolish. Some old trinkets will not turn back time. She should be back east, spending her last years with her own family instead of chasing past glories in the Abecean.

To my knowledge, she is who she claims to be. She might be overstating her family's importance to the history of Stirk Isle, though. They never rivaled the Telvor family, especially not back then. About sixty years ago they sold their last properties here and moved out east to the Heartlands. As for if 'eastern merchants and bureaucrats' were to blame for their decline, well, I'll leave that up to you to decide.

I wouldn't say that. I'm happy for the opportunities it's provided me. But I hate that it seems more interested in the appearance of control over all Tamriel than what's best for its citizens. Quite simply, the Empire has never been able to get a handle on Morrowind. And if it doesn't care enough for Black Marsh to do the bare minimum for its population, the Empire shouldn't be there either.
###

> INFO.NAME book i brought 238614828507519384
Indeed. It's rarely talked about, but I believe one of the main reasons the Empire is so reluctant to act on the subject is the sheer amount of food Morrowind exports. Mostly the result of slave labor, naturally. If the Empire were to crack down on slavery or expel Morrowind, it would come at a significant cost to its own granaries.
###

> INFO.NAME book i brought 2424970871906422943
I'm well aware, thank you. But if the Empire has to make such sordid compromises to control Morrowind, perhaps it should just let it go. And for that matter, if it cares so little for the inhabitants of Black Marsh that it would consider such a deal, perhaps it should let Black Marsh go as well.
###

> INFO.NAME book i brought 32091278822707821057
My book is 'The Eastern Provinces Impartially Considered'. I highly recommend reading the whole thing -- I can give you a copy if you'd like -- but the gist is that the Empire has continually failed to justify its expansion into Morrowind and Black Marsh. The ideal of the Empire is that of a liberator and protector, but one look at Morrowind proves that is not the case in reality. The Empire watches the Dark Elven slavers drag my people from Black Marsh and does nothing about it.

What he lacks in ambition and cunning, he makes up for with station in the Legion and willingness to aid me. The Ruby Ranks are already so mired in procedure and power grabs that they should be of no real consequence to the coup, but a military man is better to have on your side than the enemy's. He could be my captain of the guard; Chaskav certainly supports the false Queen far too much to step down quietly.

The Aster is an independent vessel, unlike most of the company-owned tradeships you see in the Port Quarter. Sometimes we ship contract cargo for the Abecean Trading Company, but our home port is Firsthold, in the Summerset Isles. We usually run textiles, foodstuffs, and other staples to the Isles from Tamriel, and ceramics, Altmer liquors, and fine artisan jewelry back the other direction.
###

And clearly, others thought so too! I drew quite the crowd, all hanging on my every word, mesmerized. There was such a hush, a reverent silence -- they felt it, my devotion and my heart on full display! How could Lysandra not see it too? Having made my love known to all of Stirk, I awaited her response, which never came. I had to try harder, I had to make a third attempt.

Although I could tell my bouquet had taken Lysandra's breath away, she still seemed... well, a tad unconvinced. But fear not, I had prepared for this! In fact, I spent that entire evening composing the most beautiful of sonnets to serenade her with. Now, I'm no poet by trade, nor a singer, but I tell you, my passion transformed me. The verses flowed truly from my heart, as if empowered by some divine inspiration. I knew it would win her heart!

Mere days after the 'near death-by-bouquet' incident, he struck again. This time, it was a public serenade -- in the middle of the street, no less! He arrived with a crumpled sheet of paper clutched in one hand, and after loudly clearing his throat, he began. Most bizarrely, he simply repeated my name in a series of odd variations: 'Lysandra! Ly-sa-sa-sa-sandra! Ly-ly-lysandra!', drawing it out as if each syllable held some deep meaning.

It's the ruins northeast of town, up on the hill. An old fort guarding the coast against the Sload. Ended up being razed by the Camoran Usurper, and the whole village with it. My family rebuilt the Lacorius Estate, and the exiled fishermen settled the coast again.

I learned about it from a collector of Nedic artifacts. She described it as an ancient sword of very fine make with the ability to sunder its victims' armor. It passed hands many times, but she was convinced that it was eventually interred with its final user in Vitta Barrow. This is our chance, %PCName. She made it clear that she'd pay handsomely for the Blade. It'll be well guarded, but if you can retrieve it, the Marshal's money problems will be a thing of the past. Good luck.

Duskwatch Keep is an old Navy fort south of Charach. It used to host a garrison, but the Navy shut it down last year. With the fort out of commission, the pirates have gotten bold enough to sail within sight of Stirk Isle in broad daylight.
###

> INFO.NAME duskwatch keep 742711165325529326
Duskwatch Keep used to be the Imperial Navy's forward base in the eastern Abecean Sea. Last year, Navy high command decided the fort was too expensive to keep running, so now it's just an empty husk.
###

This keep used to be an outpost of the West Navy, in their charge to protect the valuable trade lanes of the inner Abecean Sea. Due to budget constraints, the keep was mothballed and left vacant. We moved in and made it our guild's base not too long after that.

This keep serves our guild's purposes fairly well as a base. It's fallen into disrepair, sure. And the waters around us are now beset by smugglers and pirates. But the locals and guards don't bother us, and the fort has all the amenities we need. We even have a secret escape route for emergencies. I understand Caspus has already told you about it.

You know, it's thanks to the Imperial Simulacrum that we have this place. The Navy grew very disfavored in the public eye after that. They lost a lot of financial support and had to spread out their patrols. That led them to eventually abandon several naval forts including this one. Well, all the better for us, I'd say.

As I said, it's on the Strident Coast north of Thresvy, near the border between Anvil and Sutch. I'd suggest you make your way to Thresvy and follow the road north to the citadel.

However, that changes today. I'm sure the blockage has prevented looters from accessing the ruin's lower reaches until now. That's why I believe its varla stone is still down there, free for the taking. I didn't have the means to clear a path through the stone and rubble at the time. But that flashgrit I asked you to get should be able to blow a pathway straight through Carac Abaran. And that's exactly what I want you to do. Go to the citadel and retrieve its stone for me.

It's a sprawling Ayleid citadel on the coast north of Thresvy, near the border between Anvil and Sutch. Garlas Malatar was one of multiple Ayleid enclaves built on the Strident Coast to defend the shore against the Direnni in the late Ayleid era. But that was thousands of years ago. Today, it's an ancient ruin -- its depths blocked by stone and rubble. I tried to explore it once, years ago before I was Captain, but I couldn't get past the blockage in Carac Abaran.

I've never been to an Ayleid ruin, myself. I imagine they have a lot of loot for the taking, sure. But I also heard stories. Tales of horrible creatures inside them. Guardian spirits made of pure energy. Golden-skinned Daedra. Slaves of Ayleid sorcerers turned into twisted, reformed, undying shells. And who knows what else might be lurking in their depths. Be prepared. And be careful.

The Breton. I had the bad luck of seeing him the other night. He was indecent, dressed only in his fitted breeches and a red hat. After our short encounter he ran south and then west, towards Bendu Olo's statue, though I think he was looking for the way into Little Arenthia.

As I said, he left nothing of his possessions in our care. However, he was in that state of mind where disrobing happens to be the most amusing pastime one can think of, so perhaps his clothes ended up elsewhere. He was not making any attempts at discretion, either. Maybe he passed someone in the street who saw what he did with his clothes?
###

He barged into the entrance chamber, drunk as a sailor, boasting of his nobility and demanding to see my ''best girls''. I told him this is a place of worship, not a brothel, to which he replied that he ''prefers Bosmer broads'', and proceeded to storm out. Well, he first attempted to strip off his clothes and dive into the reflection pool, but he was stopped. A guard evicted him before he could disgrace himself, or this temple, any further. I was firm with him, so maybe I'm the thieving witch he speaks of.

An Orc sailor? That's a rare sight. My father is an Imperial, and I used to sail with him when I was younger. To be frank, I'm not so comfortable at sea, so I'm often relegated to guard duty in the lighthouse. The Navy is all right for orcs, though. Around here, rank matters more than race. Outside these walls, the Empire isn't always as enlightened and open-minded as it's claimed to be.

Hatred for slavery runs deep in Imperial culture, a sentiment with roots as far back as the Alessian slave rebellion against the Ayleids. With slavery abolished throughout most of the Empire, modern abolitionists focus their efforts on Morrowind Province, where it remains legal. Although most Cyrodiils despise slavery, a wealthy few have set aside traditional Imperial anti-slavery attitudes in favor of profitable business opportunities in the plantations and mines of Morrowind.

You should make sure to carry some form of Divine Intervention with you, in case of an emergency. The spell will, by the grace of the Divines, return you to their nearest place of worship, where a healer should be able to help you in a safe environment. Most temples or chapels of the Great Faiths or the Imperial Cult have a priest who can teach you Divine Intervention, myself included.

I'm sure you've seen that big elven tower to the southwest. It may look half as grand as White-Gold itself, but the truth is that it's just a ruin, like most any Ayleid structure around here. Recently, a party of archaeologists from the Heartlands was coming up the Gold Road towards it.

There's a cave named Melestrata a little walk southwest of the farm. It once served as a den for a gang of smugglers. I haven't seen the occupants around here lately, thankfully. It makes me wonder if something happened to them. My son thinks the guards finally got them, but I'm not so sure. If you're thinking of going anywhere near the place, be very careful.

Well, if you insist. When I was young, my great-grandfather used to tell me about his great-aunt's stories of how life was in Old Thresvy -- the fishing village surrounding Old Thraswatch. The Vadich family was to be reckoned with, back then! According to old Argalus, my family's treasure is still buried in these ruins.

When you're out doing fieldwork, you might spot odd-looking white pillars that jut out of the ground like bones. Those are Ayleid ruins. And you don't want to poke around in them unless you absolutely have to or you're VERY well prepared.

If you go wandering in the hinterlands, you'll probably run into one of the old Reman forts. Impressive structures, but sadly not suited for current warfare practices. Second Empire Legion equipment can fetch a decent prize, but the old armories are often guarded by... things. They say Reman demanded absolute loyalty -- of his soldiers, his servants, even the brick and mortar of his forts -- and this loyalty still fuels something wandering those halls.
###

If you go on a pilgrimage, keep your eyes open for wayshrines, old temples or sanctuaries. There are many such places across Cyrodiil, dedicated to the spirits, saints, or Divines, and honoring their presence will grant you blessings and fortitude. Just beware of the animals, evil spirits, and lawless men who sometimes infest such holy places -- if you can, you should cleanse them, but if not, stay away for your own soul's safety.
###

Out on the road, it pays to look into any caves or old ruins you pass by. Sometimes, they're just nests for wild animals, but often caves like those are used by smugglers or bandits. Such outlaws have no rights, and any soldier -- or private citizen -- who can deal with such vermin has a legal claim to their possessions.
###

Ayleid ruins are wondrous places -- filled with magical artifice and arcane secrets the likes of which we can only dream of. But studying these remnants is dangerous, and many a Mages Guild scholar has lost their lives to the wardens of the Ayleid Hegemony. These include the Daedra, whom the Ayleid kings patronized, but also spirits and mortal remains animated by their intricate understanding of the living energies.
###

> INFO.NAME little secret 2509376963013220743
Plundering a Colovian tomb or a Niben catacomb is a great way to make a profit without without the inconvenience of guards and alert citizens. Relics of the saints and ancestors fetch a good price on the market, and merchants generally don't care where they're from. Just beware of the dead: the old Imperial court wizards were rather bellicose with necromancy spells, and very creative when it came to defending their patron's ancestry.
###

> INFO.NAME little secret 573950921389228252
Cyrodiil has seen many wars, and the land is littered with the remnants of past conflicts. Take the old Reman forts you see in the hinterlands, for example. These were built by the rulers of the Second Empire, who waged a constant war of conquest across all of Tamriel. The fortresses fell into disrepair during the Interregnum, but it is said that their halls are haunted to this day by the echoes of legions past, animated by their undying loyalty to the great Reman.
###

> INFO.NAME little secret 91621767814387376
Of Cyrodiil's relics of the past, the old Marukhati monasteries are among the most unnerving. These ruins, which can be found throughout the Nibenay and eastern Colovia, were warped by the rituals of the Alessian Order and are inhabited today by fractured spirits outside of time. Despite the danger, many fools and fanatics feel drawn to them for the priceless relics and holy writs which the monasteries' vaults have kept secure into the present day.
###

Scattered Colovian Tombs can be found across the western highlands. Such tombs once served as the final repose for kings and saints of the Colo-Nordic nobility, but as the old families changed and died out, they have become obsolete. This does not mean they are safe, however -- for all their piety and honor, the old Colovian kings had no problem with using necromancy to safeguard their treasures.

They say that, in other provinces, vampires can be recognized by their monstrous features. Here in Cyrodiil, vampires are said to be weaker, but they can hide and pass among normal people unnoticed. People claim that the Mages Guild and the Imperial Curia are infested by vampire nests, and that they conspire with the vampires to keep the common people in line.

Close to the cities and major settlements, Cyrodiil is a civilized, peaceful place. But if you wander out into the wilderness, you're going to be in a lot of danger. It used to be that the Imperial Legion kept the peace in the hinterlands, but their attention is now drawn to the unruly provinces. These are uncertain times. If you don't want any trouble, make sure to avoid the upper Colovian Highlands, and the forbidden jungles of Blackwood and the Serican Woods.

Poor Joron. He thinks that he's made the deal of a lifetime, but even though his fields are of an impressive size, they are some of the worst farmland Medina Talgiana owns. And he has to pay her a good chunk of his harvest as rent too, so at the end of the season he barely breaks even. I probably make more money working at the Talgiana Orchard than he does 'owning' his own.

Cyrodiil is at peace, but the effects of the Simulacrum can still be felt. Faith in the Empire has been shaken. The Elder Council is becoming a tool for demagogues and provincial agitators serving the interests of the merchant princes. The purge of Tharn collaborators has weakened the nobility, Curia and Legions, leaving incompetents to fill the gaps. The Great Faiths offer only their immaterial and hermetic message, which only serves to drive the common folk to extremist minority cults.

Cyrodiil's economy is based mostly on foreign trade. Imperials are natural merchants and negotiators, maintaining vast trade networks all over the Empire. Everything from the smallest Nordic logging camp to the deepest ebony mines of Morrowind is invisibly connected to the great counting houses of the Imperial City.
###

Cyrodiil's economy is mostly trade-based, but there are some key native industries. Colovia has its farms for wheat and grain, and herds of cattle and goats. There are also some mines, quarries, and charcoal burners, though they are not very profitable. Most of this production goes west, to feed the valley cities. The Nibenay itself produces fish and rice for its own consumption, as well as luxurious products like silk, oils, perfumes, and dyes, which are then traded for foreign imports.

By Imperial law and custom, killing is fair in war, self-defense, defense of property, affairs of honor, and sanctioned affairs of state.

Cyrodiil is home to a great array of different armor styles. Colovians favor solid, common materials, like studded leather, fur, iron and steel. The Nibenese prefer eclectic armor types, like newtscale, dragonscale, various cult-related bronze alloys, and rare armors made of solidified silk. Besides these, standard-issue Legion gear is common and widespread. And, of course, equipment from all over the Empire and even beyond can be found at many of the major trade hubs.

As a nation of merchants, Imperials take a dim view on thievery. Common thieves can expect harsh punishment from local authorities. Things are very different for the Thieves Guild, who act as if untouchable. The merchants, no matter their misgivings, need their services for smuggling, distributing illegal goods, and the occasional act of sabotage. Dignitaries are bribed and blackmailed, if they are not members of the Guild themselves.
###

Considering the importance of trade in the Empire, it should be no surprise that smuggling is a popular crime in Cyrodiil. Most operations are run by the Thieves Guild, though key markets are outside their reach, such as the Dunmeri slave trade or the Khajiiti monopoly on skooma and moon sugar. Smuggler's coves are plentiful along the Strident Coast and in Topal Bay, though secret routes run across the mainland too.

Verbal assault and pickpocketing are malfeasances, punishable by fines and compensation of less than 100 drakes, or by punitive labor. Theft and foul murder are felonies. Theft is punishable by fines and compensation proportional to the value of the property stolen, or by punitive labor. Foul murder is punishable by fines and compensation of at least 1000 drakes, or by punitive labor.

Rural Imperials live in villages and small farmsteads. Some of the more remote settlements are vulnerable to raids by bandits, but most are protected by the patrols and strategic garrisons of the Imperial Legion. Most citizens live in towns and cities, usually centers of trade along the Imperial Highways or major rivers. Most major settlements have defensive walls, once merely a sign of privilege and self-governance, but now a sad necessity in these uncertain times.

There are three major cultural groups in Cyrodiil. Colovians are sober, pious folk from the west. They make up the bulk of the Imperial Legion, and Colovian-style towns can be found all over Tamriel. The eclectic Nibenese live in the east, and form the backbone of Cyrodiil's administrative and merchant classes, as well as the Legions' elite battlemages. The final group consists of immigrants who have either assimilated into Imperial culture, or defiantly stick to their own.

The three armor styles common here are light, medium, and heavy. Light armor is weak but less tiring to wear, and is better for fast running. Heavy armor is strong but slow and tiring. Medium armor is a compromise between light and heavy. The fourth style is unarmored, evading attacks rather than absorbing them with armor.

Cyrodiil is connected by a network of Imperial Highways, all converging on the Red Ring Road around Lake Rumare and Cyrodiil City. Some, like the Gold Road to Anvil, are entirely within Cyrodiil. Others, like the Orange Road to Wayrest or the Purple Road to Narsis, cross into other provinces.

In Cyrodiil, whether you're a professional mercenary, a pilgrim, or a traveler, you'll want some armor. Shields are basic protection, but limit you to one-handed weapons. For body armor, get a cuirass first for the chest, then greaves for the legs, helm for the head, and boots for the feet. Add left and right pauldrons for upper arms and gauntlets or bracers for lower arms. Balance protection against weight; you can't fight if you're exhausted by the weight of your armor.

Cyrodiil is governed by three major castes: the Colo-Nordic nobility, the Nibenese Hierophants, and the Imperial Curia. If you want to attain social status, you should pledge yourself to one of them. The Colo-Nords are Colovia's rulers, sober, austere, and war-like. They favor purity of blood, but it is possible to earn their respect. The Hierophants are the battlemage-aristocray of the east, cunning and adept in forbidden magics. The Curia, finally, are the Empire's administrative meritocracy.

Cyrodiil history is defined by the Three Empires. The First Empire was founded by Saint Alessia, who, according to legend, defeated the Ayleid Hegemony and freed the Nedic slaves. The Second Empire was founded by the god-warrior Reman, and was later managed by his Akaviri Potentates.

As it wears out, armor becomes less effective. Broken armor is completely useless until you repair it, but worn armor stops only a fraction of the damage that new or well-maintained armor does. Learn the basics of armor repair, and go over your armor, piece by piece, before every big battle. Or visit a smith regularly to keep your armor in good shape.

Spears are long, two-handed weapons, usually with a sharp point at the end. This includes other poleweapons with more elaborate blades, like halberds. Spears are useful for keeping an enemy, a wild animal, or even an unruly mob at bay, which makes them a favorite of hunters and guards.
###

Axes are top-heavy weapons, usually with simple grips and a single- or double-bladed head. They come in both one-handed and two-handed varieties. Some axes are tools first and foremost, and only used as weapons in emergencies, but purpose-built axes for warfare have been part of martial traditions all over Tamriel, especially among Nords and Orcs.

Blunt weapons refers to a wide range of heavy, percussive weapons that deal damage through their sheer weight. They come in one-handed varieties, from simple clubs to spiked maces, and two handed-varieties, fearsome warhammers and some types of blunt polearms. Blunt weapons require strength to use effectively, or to even carry around on a regular basis. Staffs are also a type of blunt weapon, but they are lighter and more versatile, at the cost of being less effective.

One-handed long blades can be carried on the hip, and are still relatively light and convenient, at least compared to weapons like axes and spears.
###

The Great Faiths support a syncretic belief in the Divines, meaning that they believe all the different interpretations of the gods one finds in the provinces are imperfect reflections of the true Nine Divines. Followers of the Faiths attempt to worship these true spirits, free from the misinterpretation and distortions of the mortal realm. Some charismatic sub-cults, however, embrace a single facet of a Divine to the exclusion of all other interpretations.

The Great Faiths honor the Divines in chapels or temples dedicated to their name. Most temples honor one Divine specifically, though all can be called upon in any place of worship. Nevertheless, many people prefer to make a pilgrimage to a specific shrine if they require a special blessing. This goes double for the High Temples in some cities, or the holy places in the Imperial City or Sancre Tor.

Daedra worship is perfectly legal in Cyrodiil, though it is more popular in the Nibenay than in Colovia. Usually, the Daedra cults offer specific services and rites that other faiths can't -- or won't -- offer. The Empire tolerates them, as they have historic precedent and offer a pressure valve for some unseemly impulses in the population.

Colovians are sober, hardworking folk who live in the western highlands. They make up the bulk of the Imperial Legions and are most commonly found in the outer Provinces. The Nibenese are a cosmopolitan people inhabiting the jungled valleys of the east. They are the elite merchants, mages, and dignitaries of the Empire.

We Bosmer often organize our families and allegiances on a tribal basis, though not every Bosmer is part of a tribe, nor does every Bosmer use their tribe names when dealing with foreigners, especially outside the reaches of Valenwood's borders.

Tribal traditions and doctrines vary from tribe to tribe and council to council. Generally speaking, to be a Bosmer without a tribe deems you unreliable, unknown, and untrustworthy. Most Bosmer tend to form their own tribes, or declare themselves one-elf tribes. But they typically don't get the same respect as a proper, established tribe. I was one of those Bosmer unlucky enough to be born tribeless, but that's no longer the case thanks to you.

A Bosmeri tribe, like us Srethuunu, is an organization of families or individuals under a leader known as an Agha. Every tribe has an Agha who is selected by their tribesmer, whether they be an heir or not. Tribes can be formed of any number of Bosmer who wish to form one, and admittance is decided solely by the Agha. When one leaves or is exiled from a tribe, they lose their tribe name and become tribeless, or 'kulaerthi'. For us native Bosmer, anything is better than being tribeless.

This was ten years ago, and everybody who knows Anvil's history knows this fact. But what many don't know is that the King had taken to a life of crime.

It's a great place to rest if you don't want to pay for an inn at Thresvy. It's mostly local fisherfolk who make use of it, but they've been kind enough to let me stay here. I took a peek into that cave at the back too. But I'm not dumb enough to go in there any further than that. It's a steep passage with a stream running down it, so one slip and you'll crack open your head on the rocks.
###

It's a little refuge for us local fisherfolk. If we need a place to sleep or do repairs we can seek shelter here. There are no permanent residents and we all come and go as we wish. Sometimes other travelers rest here too and tell us stories about their journeys. You're free to use the bedrolls by the fire, but please leave our belongings alone. And stay out of the cave at the back. It's called Sodden Hollow, and we've never explored it fully. The descent looks very dangerous.

It's good that the bridge is fixed, but it's a shame it couldn't have been replaced by a brick one, like the other ones around the village.

Though she is clearly unfit to wear the copper crown, I would not be forcing her out of Goldstone had Mykol Hadrach and Olen Benirus not proved both the necessity and possibility of a coup.

You'll have to defeat all of your opponents for the story to work. We cannot simply have them let you win, though. That would be rigging the bets that our patrons place. Now take this mask. You'll have to wear it if you're fighting here, so don't lose it. Return to %name when you wish to give a performance here.

Yes, a new performer. The rake has been short, you see, so Mr. Derrissa came up with an idea for a story. Some would call it in poor taste, but Mr. Derrissa thinks that a bit of controversy would be good for the coffers. The story needs new blood, though. And finding a good performer is hard enough. One who can hold their own in a fight? Near impossible. Bah.

Hm? You're looking to help me out? Well, I've had something of a run of bad luck lately. While coming back from my pilgrimage to the wayshrine of Akatosh to the southwest, I was stopped by a group of bandits. They harassed me, took almost all of my gold, and threatened my life if I didn't hand over my lucky family sapphire amulet as well. So I'd like you to go and get that amulet back. The bandits had some kind of hideout in Blackfish Cave, by Garlas Agea, the big Ayleid ruin not far to the southwest.

We've really got to get that Nord moved to a different cell. You may not know this, %PCClass, but in this fine city murder is against the law. However, between you and me, many of us find it most disagreeable that a pirate vessel like the Heat Lighting is moored in our harbor. Off you go then.

Ah, the pirate turned privateer. And at the behest of our beloved Queen! Let me remind you, %PCClass, that murder is against the law in this fine city. But, just between you and me, many of us aren't too keen on seeing a pirate vessel like the Heat Lightning moored in our harbor. Off you go then.
###

That'd be the captain of the Heat Lightning. She's moored in the harbor, but I'd steer clear if I were you. They've still got that pirate blood in them.
###

The farther you get from the harbor, the lower the voices get when her name is mentioned. She captains the Heat Lightning, a once feared pirate vessel. Story goes that Urri the Red betrayed her second-in-command in exchange for a letter of marque from the Queen. Nowadays she lives in the luxurious Seastone House. Most of her crew remains on the Heat Lightning, which is moored in the harbor.

Urri the Red is a pirate -- well, an ex-pirate -- who made nice with Queen Millona just a few months ago and got welcomed into the Crown's service. Urri's moved into the Port Quarter, and docked her infamous pirate galleon right in the harbor. Nobody's very happy about it. There's still a lot of bad blood with the merchants.

It's a very special charm to me. I got it while I was in Nibenay. The person who sold it to me said it belonged to some cult devoted to a Niben fortune deity named Hora. I didn't care much about the cult, but I was told the amulet would bring me great fortune. So I bought it. And you know what? It really worked. My comrades and I won many septims playing nine-holes at the Abecette with that lucky charm. We never lost. And we would've kept winning too, if it hadn't been for that damn Mudalius Horvall.

The sole reason I haven't killed you yet for proposing a deal like that to the prince is that you seem to want him alive for all this, and that Josian seems to think another layer of protection around him wouldn't hurt. If any of that changes, then so will my position.
###

If you think this deal means that you and your Order get to bend him to your every whim, know that nothing could be further from the truth. He has been allowed to get involved in this political affair because we don't think it threatens him, and because it is a one-time bargain.
###

So that shady Nord over at the fight pit is no longer a threat? Well, I might regret this, but you did protect me at least once, and a deal is a deal. I'll leave Anvil and try to be my most distracting for a bit -- as long as your Order continues to keep me alive.

Such things aren't unheard of for a prince, and Vatasha and Josian doubted it was serious, so we just moved back here and they promised to be on the lookout. But I'd like to know what he was up to. And if he was planning to harm me, then I want him gone.

Hmph. Everyone seems to want something from me these days. You may not be wrong, though.

But before I agree to anything, I'll need you to prove your good intentions -- and that your people can actually be of help to me. Go to the fight pit at the Abecette, find out what that shady-looking Nord was up to, and if he is a threat to me, then kill him.

I suppose there's not much harm in telling you. It wasn't long after the Simulacrum, you see, and she had gotten it into her head that I was a Daedric impostor. So one night, she decided to walk right into my chambers and try to stab me. I was lucky enough to have another guard in there to stop her, but that look of hate in her eyes as she was sent off to the Imperial Prison never left me.

As a son of the Septim line, there are many who would seek Enman's death, and even his bodyguards are not able to deal with every threat.

He has arrived at Goldstone on his airship to see the sights of Anvil; to experience its clubs and taverns. The Prince is known for his drinking habit, and this appears to just be another one of his vacations, albeit a poorly timed one for us. Attempting to execute our plans with him in the city would be unacceptable, as I am sure the Legions would be more willing to prevent my coup if the future of Empire were at stake.

As prince of the Empire, we are obligated to treat him with all due deference. Still, his arrival poses some challenges.

You're looking to find a seadrake egg? That's a difficult proposition -- most were ground up for potions or hoarded by collectors in the years since the seadrakes disappeared. I've read that seadrakes often used to lay their eggs in hidden places protected by coral reefs. Deep grottoes and so on. There's a reef west of Anvil called White Reef. If you're set on scouring the sea for a live egg, that's where I would start. Here, I'll mark the reef on your map.

Clisius' dagger? He speaks the truth. A land dreugh stole it and fled to the west along the river. Clisius is an able fisherman. But he's been in a bad way since his dagger was stolen. Maybe it brought him luck. Maybe he just thought it did, and that was enough. It'd be a great help to us if you found it.

That dagger's been passed down through my family since the reign of Uriel V, and it's brought us much luck over the years.

A land dreugh stole it! We were bringing our catch ashore toward the end of the day. I kissed the pommel of my dagger as I always do after returning home, and put it in the sand while I worked the ropes. A moment later, a land dreugh snatched it with a pincer and scurried away. Miris saw it happen.

On the hunt for some pearls, eh? Well, you've come to the right woman! The first thing to bear in mind is that pearl kollops and clams can be found in just about any deep body of water.

I've written down a certification of your plans in this letter, and attached some charts and instructions for the merchants to use, but I'd really like to say that this mission is a bad idea. I think I've planned out a decent route, and perhaps it's the best one there is available, but these brothers are still sailing through treacherous and unknown seas for longer than they'd be prepared to. I hope that they know that, and know the risk that they're taking.
###

> INFO.NAME viable route 7711123152231229488
Even taking the shortest path up north, and assuming good weather the whole way, it'd make the journey considerably longer. Once you get past Yokuda, though, you're in unknown waters. Our maps don't go out that far, so all you could really do is keep sailing west until you make it to Akavir. But now that we've established the route, let's finish things up.

###

If you managed to make it through those waters, then it'd mostly be just continuing to sail west until you reach Akavir. Unless there are other isles out there that we don't know about, but in that case I can't really help you anyway. Anyway, now that we've established the route, let's finish things up.

Well, after presumably getting hold of a few more supplies, you'd end up leaving to the northwest -- make sure not to head too far further south; the waters there are full of shallow reefs that might catch a ship unawares. Then, you'd just sail west for however long it takes you to make it to Akavir. But now that we've established the route, let's finish things up.

In that case, you'd probably just keep on sailing for a long time until you make it to Akavir. Our maps get less reliable the further west you go, so your guess for when that'd be is as good as mine. But now that we've established the route, let's finish things up.

Then, after that, there'd be a long stretch of open sea before you make it to Yokuda. The options aren't great once you make it there, though. You might go between Vathi and Samara, which is mostly uncharted and has poor visibility with all the frequent storms going on, or you could head to the far north of the isles, which would make the journey much longer and a great deal colder. Which of those sounds better?
###

Then, after that, there'd be a long stretch of open sea before you make it to Yokuda. Keeping onwards through the Sea of Pearls would get you to Akavir faster, but it might be wise to stop off at Nalonga or Ravan instead. Neither of them are well charted, but they'd be more likely to have a few people or villages with some supplies and food for the second leg of the journey. Of course, they'd also be more likely to contain some of the nastier things still lurking around from Old Yokuda. Which sounds better?

Next, you could either keep sailing straight out to the Systres, or go northwest and head past Caspar and Herne. Of the two, the Systres are a bit harder to get to, but going to Caspar and Herne would mean you'd have to navigate more treacherous waters later on. Neither one is itself too dangerous, though, except if you sail too close to Thras and end up with a Sload taking an interest in you. So which one would you rather go to?

You want to plan out a route to Akavir going west? I have to say that even without looking at a map, that doesn't sound like a good idea, but I suppose I can try to help you. Hang on a moment while I get out some charts... alright. So if you start out in, say, Anvil or Charach, and sail out into the Abecean, you'd want to stock up some more in Stros M'Kai -- it's the last real city out on the way, unless you make a detour to Hegathe.

The Baths are used for the more exclusive rituals of our temple. We normally only open them to our favored worshippers, so you should be honored that I'm giving you this opportunity to see them. Take the stairs down to the bottom floor of the Auditorium and enter the Hermitage. Go down two further flights of stairs until you reach the door to the antechamber on the western side of the Temple. From there, it's another staircase up to get to the entrance of the Frigidarium. The Sacred Baths are beyond that.

###

Isor's kidnappers have demanded a wagon of valuables be delivered to Talgiana Crypt in exchange for his release. Now, it is the Marshal's responsibility to protect those on the local roads, and his reputation will be unsalvagable if Isor isn't returned safely. At the same time, he cannot afford to look weak by giving in to the bandits' demand. Therefore, as the Marshal's most resourceful servant, it falls to you to rescue Isor. Make your way to Talgiana Crypt as soon as possible. Be prepared for a fight.

She's an Imperial vigilante who operates along the border between Anvil and Sutch. As far as we can tell, she only attacks bandits, leaving ordinary travelers alone. But the Empire cannot tolerate those who live outside of Imperial law. The bounty is for 1500 septims, but only if she's captured alive. There are a number of questions we want her to answer before we decide her fate. Are you interested?

I had a look while you were exploring the library. That and your find in the throne room have given me a better idea of what happened there. It seems that Racha fled the battle to the northeast and entered the city through a hidden tunnel. Racha sealed himself in the throne room, but the Nedes managed to secure the keystone. When they tried to retreat and gather reinforcements, Racha's soldiers collapsed the tunnel. That's my best guess, at least.

A collapsed tunnel and evidence of a battle. I wonder if the humans were fighting their way out or fighting their way in. If they were fighting their way out, it could have been an escape attempt by a group of slaves. If they were fighting their way in it would be more complicated. I've never seen a source indicating a direct attack on the city. Racha was defeated in the field. Perhaps the Nedes were chasing stragglers. Unless... no, an absurd notion. I would like to see this Nedic Stand myself, though.

The Dasek Marsh is a swampy region along the northern bank of the Strid River, stretching across three Kingdoms from Agi Bay near Anvil to the ruins of Woodhold south of Skingrad. Agriculture is difficult in the marsh, and hunting even moreso, so most economic activity comes from fishing in the bountiful Strid, as well as from commerce across the river with Valenwood in quasi-religious trade fairs called stridmeets. Linnath is the largest settlement in the region.

The Dasek Marsh is a swampy region of mangrove trees, pools, tall reeds and cane-grass along the northern bank of the Strid River. It extends from Agi Bay to the west down a long stretch of coast well past the old Reman fort Woodhold to the east. Linnath is the largest town in the region, close to Kvetchi Pass. Smaller settlements in the region include Archad, bordering the Strident Coast, and Tarrich, close to the West Weald.

Well, normally we charge for consultations. But you seem like you have friends in high places. Let's settle for you keeping the So-Mitana Company in mind when you do business next, hmm? Now then. The White Scarab Company is a big player in the salt market, and the Abecean Trading Company is very well-connected. It might take a bit for the effects to show, but I can imagine that acquisition being disastrous for Hammerfell's salt exports. Let me summarize my thoughts for you.

###

I haven't decided how I'll be voting. On one hand, I do see the benefits this would have for the company. On the other, I take my position as the company's head of operations in Hammerfell seriously. At present, the %Faction conducts a great deal of business with Hammerfell salt exporters who want their product moved overseas. But if we acquire the White Scarab Company, we will become those firms' competitors. I have a hard time believing that we will remain on good terms with them, if that happens.

###

Micella mentioned that you'd be coming to oppose the acquisition. You know, I've done the math. This deal would help the Kingdom too. Considering the amount of salt we'd be moving and the current tax rate on it, the royal coffers would be taking in almost twice as much from the company as they would without it. And we, of course, would benefit from the streamlined and shortened supply chain. Everybody wins.

###

Yes, it's risky, but you also need to consider the reward. Sourcing our goods is one of the hardest parts of running the company. If the acquisition is a success, we'd be able to focus more on the parts of business which really matter -- distribution and transportation. There's no place for fear. It has to be done.
###

> INFO.NAME acquisition 575524481173057452
It's a tricky situation, isn't it? I haven't cast my vote yet, but I'm leaning towards approving the acquisition. It's simply too big of an opportunity to pass up. And yet... well. It's Sutch's biggest company, and we haven't gotten King Attrebus' approval. It feels like the kind of thing that might inspire retaliation.
###

Obviously, as a member of the board, I must give the chairwoman the respect she's due. And obviously that means no gossiping about the fit she threw when she realized the vote was going to fail. But if I was free to speak my mind on the subject, I would say that it was hilarious.

It's moving too fast. On paper it looks good, but I don't think Micella understands what a shift this would be for the company. Until now, we've focused solely on distribution and transportation. Folding in the White Scarab Company's operations would mean dealing with production as well. It's not something we're equipped to deal with. At least, not without a lot more planning.
###

Good. As you may know, Herrius Thimistrel has a great deal at stake in this acquisition, and he would very much like to see it go through. He has seen your skills in action, and thinks that they would be better put to use serving the interests of the whole Kingdom instead of just the Queen -- and that they ought to be better rewarded, too. But the Intendant would require a show of good faith before you begin working for him. For example, getting rid of a board member who won't see things our way.

The letter that told us to expect you also mentioned that the Queen had some reservations about the acquisition. To speed this along, I'll make it very clear: I will be voting in favor. This is the logical next step for the %Faction, and you should accept it as the gift to Anvil that it is. You have no legal basis to reject it and, frankly, no reason to be here.

One more thing. In the event that you completed your task successfully, the Queen instructed me to offer you the sale of the city's newest home, Goldenrod House, before it reaches the common market.

The Abecean Trading Company, of which Herrius Thimistrel is the majority shareholder, is in talks to acquire the White Scarab Company, the leading producer of salt in Cyrodiil and the largest company in Sutch. The White Scarab Company is amenable to the offer, and legally, the deal is entirely above-board. Under the surface, however, I believe there's something darker brewing.

The Abecean Sea lies between Cyrodiil, Hammerfell, the Summerset Isles, and the Eltheric Ocean. It is a placid sea, criss-crossed by trade lanes that connect the major ports of the West. The Abecean is full of small islands, and a few big ones. The closest large island to Cyrodiil is Stirk Isle, just off the Strident Coast, but there are several smaller ones near mainland Cyrodiil, like the Mykoi Isles and the Viduscan Isles.

The stairs to Nagaseli are just over there. Make sure you bring both the varla stone and keystone back with you. I advise you to be careful with the varla stone, though. Handling one for any length of time can be... extremely unpleasant.

Fantastic. Now listen closely. The doors in this ruin are locked with small stones called keystones. I have one, but it only opens the door to the section called Nagaseli. The catacombs. I believe the city's varla stone is there. I also believe that there is a keystone there that will unlock a different section of the ruins. Nagaseli is guarded by the Ayleids' redeemed servants, so be careful. I will pay you once you bring both of those things to me. Here is the keystone that unlocks Nagaseli. Good luck.

I won't pretend I'm not still angry that the Dibellans just took our gift and turned us away. But I'm glad that it didn't stop us from finding a place to take up service. And hey, since we're right by the city gates, maybe I can try telling incoming pilgrims that the Temple of Dibella Estetica just isn't worth their time. Hah!
###

I warned them about it and everything. I was worried they might reject the gift, but no -- they had no problem with it, apparently. Only with us. I'm sure they're going to put it on display as some great offering to Dibella's majesty, made by a dedicated soul with no expectations of receiving anything in return; not even the opportunity to further serve the temple. Pah!

I thought it'd be wise to bring some sort of gift for the temple to get them to accept us, and what better gift for the Dibellans than an artifact of beauty? I had heard rumors that this ruin might have a varla stone in it, but I just can't get to it. See, I think there used to be some kind of treasure chamber in the flooded part below us, but... well, it's flooded. Not to mention the traps guarding it, or the fact that I can't even find the entrance. That's why I'm asking you for help -- I want that stone.

It's said to be a crystallization of magical starlight. Scholars have differing beliefs for how the Ayleids used it. Some say it was used to enchant items, at a level far stronger than any soul gem. Others believe the Ayleids used it to power their vast ancient cities. But those details don't concern me. What's important is that a single stone is extremely valuable. And I believe the one in Garlas Malatar is particularly suitable for my endeavors. I want you to go there and get it for me.

Thank you, my friend. You spoke the truth to me, when no one else would. I'll take your advice, and head to Anvil. I've always heard Little Arenthia is nice. Perhaps that's where I'll go. Feel free to make use of my house, I'll be leaving soon and have no use for it.

What are you talking about, %pcname? She's simply playing hard to get! She wants me to prove my affection for her. Anyone can see that. It's only a matter of time until she comes to see sense, to see that she loves me back... Isn't it?

Yes, yes give it here! I've waited long enough... *urk!*... *huuurgh!*... *BLEERGHHH!* ...by ...by the Divines, I've never felt so awful in my life. I can't believe I was going to make her drink something I made if... I don't deserve her. I should leave Stirk -- no, I'm going to leave Stirk. I'm catching the next ship that departs. There's nothing left for me here now. I appreciate all the help you gave me. You can have my house; I intend to start afresh. Goodbye.

I guess that means one could say that the secret ingredient is... love. Ah, of course -- I should explain. There's actually two potions. One I plan to drink myself, a charisma potion, to ensure my love can express itself unhindered. And the other, is a carefully concocted love potion, made just with Lysandra in mind. This plan simply cannot fail!

I don't care whether they're lovers or hunting partners! What is insufferable here, is that the Queen's brother would stoop to socialize with the lowest dregs that muddle around our city. As nobles, our duty is to uphold the highest standards of honor and prestige! As her Majesty's steward, I am to make sure a knight of the kingdom, Marshal of the Coast, and member of the royal family doesn't tarnish the Queen's reputation! Not in public at least.

Enough of this! The two of you are clearly stronger than I thought. You don't need to kill anyone else to prove that. I surrender.

Be realistic, %PCName. We don't know how badly wounded he is, where he went, or if he's alive at all. By the time we find him, even if he's in a state to rule the Kingdom, Millona will have tracked us down and dealt with us as she sees fit. And if I were you, I wouldn't rely on her mercy.

I'm not overthrowing her. I'm arresting her for crimes against the Kingdom, and stepping into her position as a suitable replacement.

Forget all that and just be practical for a second! If you're really going to turn yourself in to the guards, or be on the run from the law for the rest of your life, then feel free to do just that. I'll still be here when you come to your senses. Besides, I really doubt that was the only reason you helped Herrius. There's no shame in it. I want revenge, you want... whatever you want. Power?

The two of us could storm Goldstone and make our way up to the Great Hall. It would be a difficult battle; Millona's fortified her position well. But I know my skill and I know yours.

I was hoping that Herrius would be here to figure another way out, but given he won't be joining us, I could sit on the throne instead. The Hadrachs used to be prestigious enough to have a real shot at winning the royal auction, and the chaos that Millona's unleashed on Anvil is just the excuse we need to put someone legitimate back in power. Admiral Hasi's not a problem, you're an officer of the crown, and the Queen just tried to kill several esteemed members of the community. It's the best option we have.

%PCName! Thank all the gods and saints you're here. Wait, what's this about Herrius Thimistrel? He's GONE? I can't believe this! Without his resources and right to the throne... well. If we let the guards catch up, it's off to the gallows with us. You've probably seen already that Queen Millona has named me, you, and anyone else who assisted us a traitor to be captured or killed. Even with that, though, we might still have a chance to oust her.

So we meet again, %PCName. It's a sad sight to see the one who bested the Masqued Captain consorting with traitors to the crown, but your past actions will win you no mercy from me. Your master couldn't hide from Queen Millona's justice -- he fled like a dog when wounded, and we will track him to his final grave. You will be no different!

I know you, %PCName; killer of Lantin Chaskav and traitor to the crown. There's no more hiding from Queen Millona's justice. Your master seemed to think otherwise, and maybe he can run for a time -- even with how badly we wounded him. But you, at the very least, will die here!

You're late, %PCName. Captain Ulius seemed quite surprised that you weren't here to back him up. I'd thank you, but seeing as you're a traitor to your Queen and Kingdom, that'd be best saved for once your body gets thrown off the docks. Don't get any ideas about running back to that bastard Thimistrel, either -- the Queen's sent out her best guards to deal with him. Now, enough talk. Let's settle this.
###

Good evening, Captain Ulius. And good evening to you too, %PCName. How lucky of me to find two traitors to their Queen and Kingdom in one place. A shame I couldn't kill off that bastard Thimistrel too, but Millona did say that her best guards had his situation under control. Now, enough talk. Let's settle this.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 1 2481621810919824847
That could have gone a lot better. Hasi may be dead now, but if Millona's sent out her guards to arrest Herrius, and if they find out what he is... I dare not even speak it. I'll take care of the body, but you must return to Thimistrel Manor. Immediately. And consider taking a less-traveled route, too, like the sewers. If Millona has branded you a traitor, the city guards will be after your head. It'd be best to keep a low profile.

If you thought I would be pleased to hear of Queen Millona's death, you are sorely mistaken, and will pay for that error with your life. Without some sort of deal being struck with her, even one at swordpoint, my kingship is illegitimate -- the crown is not yielded to me! It is shattered, withheld from all, at YOUR hand.

This stuff is property of the Emperor, so the state's paid us a fortune for finding it, and it seems likely they'll also be hiring us to start digging it up and shipping it around.

Finally! Thank you so much for your help, %PCName. It seems my bodyguards weren't far behind you. I'm sure they have their own opinions on your involvement, but I want you to know that I don't blame you for this at all. In fact, I want to reward you. I'll be leaving Anvil soon, but before I go, meet me at my airship on top of Goldstone's garrison tower.

Yes, that should work. I can't thank you enough. I don't have much right now, but believe me, I won't let you go unrewarded. Meet me at my airship on top of Goldstone's garrison tower. I'll be leaving Anvil soon, but I want to give you something first. Now if I can just... focus on the words here...

My friend! Hello again. You'll be glad to know that I found something suitable for your reward. Here -- a fine ebony cuirass.

So busy, in fact, that you're already done. I was going to tell you that you needed to get two of the other board members to oppose the deal so that we have a majority, but you just went ahead and did it. So thank you for that.

Well. Now that we're back here, and Micella Marin isn't making any more attempts on my life, we should discuss strategy. Whether or not this acquisition goes ahead is going to come down to how the board votes, and at the moment the majority is for it. I've done what I can to change the others' minds, but they don't want to hear it from me. So I'm hoping they'll listen to you instead. I have ideas for how you can convince most of the board members. Just remember that we only need two of them.

You've killed the beast? You really have? You are truly a great fisherman. If killing a fish with a sword, a spell, or a fist can be called fishing, that is.

You came all this way just to lose to the Nightingale. What a shoot.
###

This is it, %pcname. Are you ready to put on the show of a lifetime with the Nightingale?
###

Mr. Derrissa put a lot of work into this story. Don't blow it in the last moment.
###

Good work down there. I half expected Takhur the Terrible to beat you to a pulp.
###

You lost to Takhur the Terrible. Damned shame.

Are you ready for your match with Takhur the Terrible?
###

Despite the name, she's rather friendly behind the scenes.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 1578519200185721255
It's great that you won and all, but we have to talk about the remark you made to Warlord Wortgog.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 2679610512275024774
Incredibly done! Warlord Wortgog didn't know what hit him. Have you come for your coin?
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 24262990034374863
You were defeated by Warlord Wortgog. I know, he was a tough opponent, but there's a conversation that we need to have.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 3089173712850731487
Everything is in order for the show with you and Warlord Wortgog. Are you ready to begin?
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 285146416572922994
Don't let the Warlord's persona fool you. He's very smart if you ever speak person-to-person.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 1799813030108594519
Defeating King Thousand Hands will do wonders for your reputation. Here for your pay?
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 269372465452918894
Losing to King Thousand Hands. Not the greatest thing for your reputation, %pcname.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 2234525001641520517
King Thousand Hands is ready for the show. Are you good to go?
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 340927736241306304
The fans will turn out for this one. Most everybody hates King Thousand Hands.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 30011356928975735
That was a good performance you and the Armiger put on. Here for your pay?
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 289101989453923676
The Armiger defeated you. Damn shame.
###

###

%name has never been to Morrowind, but he has read Cydne Jouarge's articles in the Monitor about it. %name doesn't think he will ever go to Morrowind.
###

You brought down both of the Corsairs in style. Incredibly done.
###

Ready for your match with the Corsairs?
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 217931323261287828
Two against one. Seems rather unfair, but that's the kind of thing people come here to see.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 31446834314829916
You defeated the Knight of Cups. Speaking honestly, I'm a little surprised.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 1815232353216673649
The Knight of Cups beat you. I don't blame you -- she's a tough opponent. But we should discuss it.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 2045525221277726044
The Knight of Cups says she's ready for your show. Are you?
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 216111123198925171
That knight is a nasty one. You should watch for cuts at the eyes, %name thinks.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 17369195432257916745
I haven't seen Harge the Large take a thrashing like that in a long while, %pcname. Good job.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 196661068915874830
I saw you fight Harge the Large. Not your greatest showing, in all honesty.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 18726111141028330586
You're to fight Harge the Large. Should be a big one. Are you ready?
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 2237226112253722245
%name thinks that you should be careful for this one. Harge wasn't just given the name Large because of the rhyme.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 519824275211386136
You fought well against the Snake. Here for your pay?
###

Everything is set up for your match with the Snake. Are you ready to go?
###

That was a good show you had with Yenna, %pcname.
###

That wasn't the greatest showing you had with Yenna. Let's talk.

Ready for your match with Yenna?
###

Evening, %PCRank. I see you also like to stroll the streets of Anvil in the shade of night. Fitting enough, I suppose. I've just come out here to admire the moonlight and keep away from everyone in Goldstone. But even this refuge seems no comfort as my heart yearns for love.
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 141532600197796680
Good evening, %PCRank! I see you like to stroll the streets of Anvil in the shade of night as I do. Have you noticed how the marble walls take a tanned taint when Masser shines the brightest? But when Secunda reigns, a ghostly veil seems to have fallen upon our streets, as rivers made of a billion tiny diamonds furrow the still waters of the port! Ah, but what good are the charms of moonlight when the heart yearns for love?
###

> INFO.NAME greeting 5 5744320011402323399
Wynn, is that you? Oh, please excuse me, sir. I mistook you for a friend of mine. The eyes are dulled when the heart yearns for love.

Ah, welcome. I am Caspus Quillan, Navy chaplain of Duskwatch Keep. Are you here for services or to pay your respects to the Nine Divines? Hah! I'm just kidding. The Navy hasn't been in this mothballed fort for some time. I'm actually the %Rank of the %Faction here on Stirk Isle. So what is it, %PCRank? If you're here, I take it you're looking for jobs?

If you're here to complain about the closure of Duskwatch Keep, you're shouting up the wrong mast. The decision was entirely out of my hands. Now they have me managing recruitment here in Anvil. Believe me, I'd rather be back on Stirk.

Welcome to the Briricca Private Bank of Anvil, %pcclass. If you don't have an appointment with the director, I fear that you've made the climb to the top floor in vain.

Welcome to the Abecette, %PCClass! How about a bottle of fine Cyrodiilic brandy to celebrate your arrival? If you're feeling lucky, try a game of nine-holes -- the tables are right over there. If you're here for some excitement, pay a visit to our fight pit. Or perhaps you were looking for beds to spend the night? Best accomodation in Anvil!

I was immediately suspicious, of course. Even more so when I said I wasn't interested and she sprinted out of the store. It sounds like she's the one you want.
###

You've been expelled from the %Faction. I cannot discuss such privileged information with you.

Well done taking care of that problem.
###

> INFO.NAME sload soap 2570222862306689668
Excellent work, %PCRank. Killing even a single Sload is no small feat. With any luck, that's the last we'll see of them for some time.
###

> INFO.NAME sload soap 2709626969104742955
You've slain the Sload in Carthalo? Excellent work, %PCRank. Killing even a single Sload is no small feat. With any luck, that's the last we'll see of them for some time.
###

> INFO.NAME sload soap 1309127435804124562
Just because Pona's out of the picture doesn't mean our problem is solved. That Sload clearly has eyes for Anvil. If you don't go to take it down now, there's no telling what it might do. Report back to me when it's dead.
###

> INFO.NAME sload soap 31249274182679230631
As I feared. A Sload this close to Anvil, especially one which is interested in the city, is a recipe for disaster. It needs to be slain immediately. Travel to Carthalo as soon as possible, %PCRank.
###

> INFO.NAME sload soap 833132811501617320
It sounds like you have both a name and a destination. What's the hold up? The Navy Officer Lodgings are in the northwest part of the Port Quarter, just west of the Marina. See what you can find there.
###

> INFO.NAME sload soap 10684203651948615563
You have a description? Good. If she was wearing a Navy uniform, it stands to reason that she's part of the Navy. Maybe you could ask Admiral Hasi if he knows who she might be.
###

> INFO.NAME sload soap 27309235783264123780
As I said, your best bet is to talk to Anvil's alchemists. Even if they don't know where it's coming from, they might be able to point you in the right direction.
###

> INFO.NAME sload soap 145883946159621791
Small quantities have always made their way to Anvil from the soap refineries in the Heartlands, but this much in the city at once is unprecedented. Sload soap is made from the larval form of the Sload. It's not possible to produce without some kind of contact with them -- and I know for a fact that the refineries haven't increased their production. I need you to talk to the local alchemists and see what they know about the situation. We cannot allow the Sload to gain a foothold in Anvil, however small.
###

Sload soap is a waxy substance made from the immature non-sentient forms of the sload. Because Tamriel's relationship with the Sload has never been friendly, most sload soap in the Empire comes from the soap refineries of the Nibenay.

I don't like talking about it. I'm a simple clothier, and if I had my way that'd be the end of it. But since you've done so much for me, I'll tell you that I'm originally from Pyandonea. The specifics of how I got here are too painful to relate, and you'd never truly understand without having visited my homeland. Suffice it to say that I miss Pyandonea dearly, but I may never return, and my countrymen would shun me even if I were to encounter them again.

I fled the citadel of Mischarstette to preserve the royal line, only to rest for two eras and find the Strident Coast sacked twice over.

Sure. See the three-by-three board with white and red pins on the counter? That's the game. The winner is the first one who places the pins in a straight line.

It's a myth reaching back to the days before Anvil was a kingdom. Supposedly, the modern Shore-King is the heir to one of the Strident Coast's First Empire-era Shore-Kings. He's been waiting to claim the throne until Anvil was in its moment of greatest need, benighted by enemies within and without -- or so the story goes. It seems someone's been suggesting that his moment is now. From what I understand, the source of this nonsense is the Anchor's Rest in Little Arenthia. Go there and put a stop to it.

It's a little embarassing for me to admit, because the armor was a gift from the Navarch, but my boots, greaves, and cuirass were stolen right off my skiff. I don't know who the thieves were or where they went -- I left to greet Gracchus and Riserius, ended up talking and drinking here at the club rather too much, and then went back to pick up my things to find the armor missing. They can't have gone far. I imagine you'll find someone who knows where they went if you ask around the Garden Quarter enough.

But the guard I sent to investigate him has disappeared, so I want you to find out for certain if he was the reason she didn't come back.

So Nito Nesba has discovered a raw glass site. There are very few of those outside Morrowind, so on behalf of the Empire, I will pay him very well for its location. And due to his background in similar ventures, he's a very likely candidate for the trust to actually mine and sell the glass.

Many accused me of abusing my office when I stripped him of his titles, but nothing could be further from the truth. It is true that I come from a house of ore merchants, as he did. And it is true that we used to be market competitors. But that's precisely it: we USED to compete. The Nesbas ceased to hold relevance long ago. By my time, no one considered them notable, and in Cyrodiil, nobility is a matter of consensus. The crown's role as fount of honors is merely to confirm that consensus.
###

It is always sad to see a great family fall, but to us Cyrodiils, the only thing truly noble is the state. A family is only noble so long as it can participate in the affairs of state. The Nesbas were noble when they served the state in their given role, the navigation of certain essential markets, and now they cannot, so they are not.

Nito Nesba was once a nobleman. His family had built itself decades of prestige and wealth serving the crown, but he squandered all he inherited in gambling dens and fleshpots, and he was justly disennobled. But when he came to me begging for shelter, what was I to say? His mother was a dear friend of mine. I was obliged. I try and find him work when I can, now -- usually clerical work, for the man has a wonderful memory. If my boy weren't all grown already, I would employ Nito Nesba as a tutor.

Fine. Yes, I know him. He's one of my workers here. But he's a commoner now, and he goes by Nilius Noma. I gave him a job because he was penniless and trying to escape a ten-thousand-drake debt. He gambled away his inheritance at the Abecette over in Anvil, apparently. And now he's hiding from the pit boss, a man named Raco Derrissa. You can talk to him over by the racks if you want more information, but please don't tell that man outside. I'm almost certain he's a bounty hunter.

Strident runners are territorial, but they won't bother you if you keep your distance. Most of the time it's the rats and muskrats that catch people unprepared. Don't worry about tanthas -- they're harmless unless you're an insect.

He immediately proposed cooperation? Interesting. He does make a surprisingly convincing argument. We risk nothing by playing along, and we gain a chance at arresting a bigger fish. %pcrank, it's decided. You should continue doing whatever he asks of you.

Straler Loronus, an unassuming merchant, walked into Goldstone and confessed to manufacturing drugs. Sure enough, when the guards searched his apartment, they found a hidden skooma lab. Now he says he wants out of the trade, and in exchange for amnesty he's promising to give up something big. Your task is to visit him in Goldstone's dungeons, listen to what he has to say, and figure out whether we should trust him or not.

I never wanted to become one. For me, it was just a means to an end. I was always very good at alchemy, so why not use it to earn some easy coin for an early retirement? The trade takes a toll on you, though. It as if it turned me into another, much harsher person. One day, my wife just took our son with her and left. I don't know where she went, and honestly? I don't even blame her. Maybe it's better this way. I just wish I could have stopped sooner. But at least I stopped at all, right?
###

Well, I wouldn't call myself that, but I did make drugs, yes. And as I've told the others who questioned me, I decided to stop. Now for the other thing I said to them. You gain nothing by keeping me here. But if you decide to let me go, I can help you set up a meeting with and arrest one of my biggest distributors. I know for a fact that I'm not his only supplier, so trust me, this is someone you want.

Stridmeets are ritual trade exchanges that happen annually between Valenwood and Cyrodiil. During a stridmeet, caravans of Bosmer and Colovian merchants meet at cairns along the bank of the Strid River -- hence the name -- to trade alcohol, wood, flora, and other goods. Saint Valrad accidentally started them when he stopped a Camoran invading force at the Strid bank and offered wine to their commander, and we've continued to have them in the Dasek Marsh region ever since.

The astrolabe is a very versatile instrument. The Navy uses it to determine their location on the sea. Mages use it to study the stars and their connection to Aetherius. Astronomers and astrologers use it to chart the stars and identify the planets. The Chapel of the West Wind uses it to study the planet Kynareth, which corresponds to the Divine whom they worship. For that reason, I'm sure the chapel keeps a brass astrolabe somewhere in sight at all times.
###

The Chapel of the West Wind is the only place on Stirk Isle that has it, I believe. But there should be some others in Anvil as well. Wherever you go, may I suggest some advice?

Captain Mondirilyon has been in the West Navy for nearly a century. Before the incident last year, he had a reputation as one of the Empire's finest captains.

In this time, I am a businessman. Two hundred years now, I have prepared; two hundred years, I waited and learned from the Vampyrum Order. The Abecean Trading Company was to be my path to kingship. The royal auction would be called, I would sail off on my skiff, and every other petty noble there would be outbid. No longer. The Order counseled caution, but Queen Millona seems determined to make a sham of this once-great kingdom. And I will not stand by another time to let that happen.

I'm a warrior by trade. I know how to fight, when necessary, but I much rather look so tough that critters give up or run away when they see me. Personally, I favor long blades of all kinds -- they use long blades of many different styles and craftsmanships here in Cyrodiil -- and I wear medium armor, for a decent balance of protection and mobility. But I train with various weapon types and armor types. And like any good warrior, I'm my own armorer -- don't want to fight with worn weapons in worn armor.
###

I'm a scout. I know places, people, plants, paths, wind, and weather. I serve as guide for travelers and traders, or work as advance guard and pathfinder for expeditions. I know the geography of Cyrodiil, and the various geographic regions. My best defense is stealth, sneaking past trouble, but I can fight bow or blade, in various armor styles, when the job requires it.

I am a pilgrim. I search for enlightenment, and hope to purify my soul through facing and overcoming the challenges of pilgrimages that reenact the tests and trials of saints and heroes.

I am a necromancer. I am legally sanctioned by the Elder Council to practice my arts, in return for service to the Empire and obedience to certain rules and regulations. Many people don't understand the elegance of necromancy and will tar me the same brush as some of my fellow practioners, who are little more than grave-robbers and murderers. The truth is completely different. I obey the letter of the law and regard killing and murder with the same horror as any other person.

I am a noble, elevated by birth and distinction to the highest ranks of Imperial society. I do not have a trade, as such, though I may dabble in various affairs, collecting rare treasures of beauty and refinement. And if such things are valuable, there's no harm in it. My lofty station is not without responsibilities, of course. I must serve at the command of the Emperor and the Elder Council, giving counsel and support, and, when duty calls, taking spell and sword to protect the smallfolk of the Empire.

The Garden Quarter hosts Anvil's most upscale services. Most pilgrims are here for the Temple of Dibella Estetica. If you're looking for an expensive night, the Abecette has a hotel and a bar. The finest alchemists, smiths, and traders are all clustered near the Bazaar of the Abecean and the Briricca Private Bank. You could always try the Saint Amiel Club if you want a drink, but you might get a cold shoulder if you're not part of the Navy's officer corps.

You can find most everything in the Marina -- smithies, traders, pawnbrokers, enchanters, clothiers -- generally, the shops get nicer the closer you get to the Garden Quarter, and sketchier the closer you get to Little Arenthia. There's boat and carriage service in the Marina as well, if you need to get out of the city.

Saving souls is an expensive endeavor! She's lucky that anyone would lend her the funds she needs. But she's doing us savages such a service by taking it on herself to go preach in Valenwood. Z'en insists I repay her in kind. I gave her rates as generous to her as the generosity she's showing our people. If you'd like, though, I'm open to selling you her contract. Then you could cancel it if you want. But I'd need you to pay its full value -- plus a small processing fee, of course.

The hedonists hold to the discredited, corrupt traditions of the Nibenay, which view Dibella as a goddess of rapture, lust, desire, and sensuality. Their outlook is dangerous and corrosive to the Faith, and all those of us who earnestly seek to understand and worship the Goddess in her purity.
###

> INFO.NAME hedonist 695511435915315661
We believe in the Dibellan commandment to open our hearts to the noble secrets of love, and to seek joy and inspiration in its mysteries. Beauty and joy are the ideals of our goddess, and indeed, Anvil's many joyful and indulgent establishments were founded under her patronage.
###

Those misguided fools believe Dibella is a goddess of lust. They ran the Faith like a brothel for far too long.
###

> INFO.NAME hedonist 20813126703143716725
I don't take sides in this, but it's no surprise that the hedonists are the more popular faction. Anvil has many establishments dedicated to joy and indulgence, after all. The city's many brothels, society clubs, and even the great Abecette casino were founded under this aspect of Dibella's patronage.
###

> INFO.NAME hedonist 1763632602948019509
Traditionally, Dibella was worshipped as the goddess of lust, exhultation, and pleasure. Hedonists of the Faith believe that indulgence brings them closer to the Goddess, and that the temples should facilitate this. Hedonist ideology ruled the Cult of Dibella for centuries, but in recent years ascetics have taken over the Faith.
###

> INFO.NAME hedonist 8097235892945311899

The Kali Mes are a revolutionary group mostly made up of Syradri Redguards and their Oloman sympathizers who want Sutch returned to Hammerfell. They've been linked to all sorts of criminal business -- drug smuggling, burglaries, and, most recently, a string of high-profile attacks on unsympathetic politicians and companies. Their ties to the White Scarab Company are just one more reason why I think this acquisition is a bad idea.

Listen, I'm not saying the Kali Mes haven't done terrible things. But given how unreceptive the authorities have been, can you really blame them? They're desperate. If the people in charge would just listen, I'm sure a lot of the regrettable conduct we've seen could be avoided.
###

Exactly. Cyrodiil's theft of Sutch is unacceptable. This should be glaringly obvious to the Empire, but of course they've always been more partial to Cyrodiil than any of the other provinces. The Kali Mes aren't perfect, but they're the only ones speaking for the people of Sutch.
###

> INFO.NAME kali mes 441828051265910878
So the Kali Mes want to get Sutch back where it belongs. That's why they do what they do. Now obviously I'm not denying they've gone too far in places. But it seems awfully unfair that they're painted as having sprung out of Oblivion to wreak havoc while their actual message goes unshared.
###

If you've heard anything about the Kali Mes, I'm sure it's been that they're petty thieves and smugglers. No more than an overgrown street gang. You hear a lot less about what they actually stand for. Have you ever been to Sutch?

I'm the Reeve of Thresvy for the Kingdom of Anvil, like my father before me and his father before him, all the way back when my ancestors founded the village after Old Thraswatch was destroyed. The position isn't hereditary, though, nor is it restricted to the nobility. We're appointed and can be demoted at any time by the monarch in Anvil. But considering my family's history here, and our estate's major role in the village's economy, they'd be hard-pressed to find a better candidate for the job.

The current village was founded when my ancestors rebuilt the Lacorius Estate, some time after the armies of the Camoran Usurper swept through the Strident Coast and destroyed Old Thraswatch. My mother, Sigorn Lacorius, is a scion of Colovia's old knightly tradition. After spending some time in the Imperial Legion, she went back to take the reins of the estate after my grandfather's death, and was designated her successor as Reeve of Thresvy by King Claudius of Anvil.

Thresvy is a coastal village located between Anvil and Sutch, but away from any trade routes. Most of the population either lives from fishing or works for the local Reeve Sigorn Lacorius, who owns a massive estate made up of fields, orchards, and one of the most important breweries on the Strident Coast. The inhabitants live under the shadow of the ruins of Old Thraswatch, a millennia-old fortified town that was destroyed by the Camoran Usurper 180 years ago.
###

The fishing village of Thresvy was founded somewhat recently, a few decades after the fortified town around Old Thraswatch was razed by the Camoran Usurper some 180 years ago. Thraswatch itself is rumored to have been founded as far back as the late First Era, to defend Colovia against an invasion from the Sload. Reeve Sigorn Lacorius rules the town from her family's estate, and runs one of the biggest aliyew breweries on the Strident Coast. It was her ancestors who rebuilt the village back in the day.

The Maormer are the elves of Pyandonea, a land far to the south of Tamriel. Imperials call them 'Sea Elves', since they are almost always encountered aboard swift ships in the Padomaic Ocean and the Sea of Mists. Few Maormer live in Tamriel, and those who do tell little of their kind. Even exiles, it seems, feel an obligation to conceal Pyandonea's secrets. Maormer are adept sailors, swimmers, and handlers of ocean beasts, and it is said that they are skilled with spear and magic alike.

The Ayleids, or Heartland High Elves, established the first Elven empire on Tamriel early in the Merethic Era. Masters of the arcane arts, their civilization was nonetheless brought low by the Alessian slave rebellion. Many Imperial arts and sciences go back to Elven foundations, and the modern Tamrielic language is derived from their Ehlnofey tongue. Ayleid ruins can still be found across Cyrodiil, testament to the power of the ancients. In modern times, most Ayleids live in the autonomous Five Citadels.

Traditionally, Colovian Imperials have formed the core of the Imperial Legions and Navy, the mailed fist to the Nibenay's outstretched hand.

We Maormer are talented with magic and naturally adept in the water. Our home is the nation of Pyandonea far to the south, and we're so rare outside of it that people get funny ideas about us.

Very few people claim to have survived an encounter with a dreugh queen, and even fewer of them are credible. With that in mind, my advice for fighting one would be 'don't'. But if you're truly dead set on chasing it down... stock up on restoration potions of all kinds. Spells don't travel well underwater, so any you expect to use should work at a touch. Water breathing is a must, of course. And however strong you think you are, don't forget to bring a quick teleport out.

Hmm. Well, I'd say I know more about dreugh than almost anyone in Cyrodiil, and I still don't know that much about them. Marshal Pelelius is correct in that dreugh rarely expand their territory. The exception is when a new dreugh queen spawns. In that case, dreugh spread out around their hive quickly, silently, and violently. I can't say for sure, but that may be what's occurring in Thresvy's waters. And if so, action must be taken to kill the queen immediately.

He was here! He came in looking very agitated and rented a room upstairs. He came down once or twice for food, but other than that, I never saw him. Then, when the bounty was posted, I thought he must be S'Dato. I took one of my regular patrons to confront him. He slashed at us with his claws, then ran out of the inn and north up the main street.

I'm happy to hear you managed to take care of that situation, %PCName. Though I question the wisdom of re-using the same invocation to bind Barubi to yourself instead. These type of things rarely work twice, and I wouldn't be surprised if transferring the bonds that bound Barubi from Vyric to you weakened them. If you're an expert conjurer, they might last. But if I were you, I'd keep my eyes open around Barubi.

I highly doubt 'Barubi' is the true name of the Guardian that's bound to Vyric. Daedra are loath to share their true names. The risk of that information being used against them is far too great.
###

> INFO.NAME barubi 324294381191819277
If you're going to fight Daedra, get yourself a good weapon. Typical iron or steel is remarkably ineffective against them. Guardian Daedra in particular are completely resistant to normal weapons. Enchanted weapons should fare a lot better. Weapons made of exotic materials such as silver or gold should also work. Or High Rock mithril or elven glass, if you can get your hands on those.
###

> INFO.NAME barubi 47727685282375190
Judging by your description, we're dealing with one of the Guardian Daedra. Those are rare, very dangerous, and far beyond Vyric's skill to conjure. And that's ignoring the fact that, apparently, Vyric somehow managed a semi-stable summoning. Still, anything breaks when enough force is applied to it. If you want to deal with Barubi the old-fashioned way, remember to use an enchanted weapon, or something made of silver or some other exotic material. Guardians are immune to regular iron and steel.

We've received reports of a demon in Vyric's bookstore. Thankfully, it does not appear to be hostile or to pose an immediate threat to the public, despite its terrifying appearance.

It's a golden-colored wine made from the altachi pear. It's traditional to the city of Firsthold, the largest and oldest city in the Corcaran region on the isle of Moridunon.

Oh, that's a good wine. It can boost your magic resistance and energy for a short while. I wouldn't recommend drinking it just before a melee, though. You'll feel sluggish for a bit afterwards.

Excellent, %PCName! He's hitched at the barn outside. Please treat him well and keep him out of danger. He is special, but he is no fighting donkey. Remember, he's trained to patiently wait outside if you enter a building, and will listen to your verbal commands to 'follow' or 'stay'. And he can even be told to 'go back home' to the barn.

Donkeys make excellent beasts of burden, and I have the perfect specimen for you. His name is Padrul, and he is a very special donkey. Loyal and strong. He can carry all your burdens and more! But that's not what makes Padrul special. Most donkeys lumber along at the speed of molasses, but not Padrul. No, he's FAST! Why? It's hard to say. Perhaps he ate some magical herbs one day, or maybe he just has a noble lineage. Regardless, I simply cannot part with him for less than 2000 drakes. What do you say?

Sutch is a city on Cyrodiil's western frontier, and the capital of the Kingdom of Sutch.

In the aftermath of his defeat, the devastated Sutch was annexed to Cyrodiil and its upper district rebuilt. Sutch is home to many temples, and its position astride Soetar Gorge makes it a critical nexus of trade.

But his family were the first to settle the land again after the War of the Usurper, and that's the closest thing to a noble pedigree you're going to find in Marav.

A Reeve is an appointee of the Queen of Anvil, assigned to one of the smaller settlements throughout the kingdom. We collect taxes, keep census records, settle legal disputes, and maintain critical infrastructure like roads and bridges. My predecessor did a sorry job on that last count, so my very first act in office was replacing the collapsed wooden bridge with a new, sturdier one.

Cira Lor has only been our Reeve for a few years, but she has already left her mark on the community. She had the collapsed eastern bridge rebuilt so carts from the farms on the other side of the river can easily reach the village, and she had the water mill refurbished so that we can grind more of our grain right here.

He was a good smuggler, but he was beginning to think about retiring -- maybe settling down in a farm near Thresvy. We arranged things so that he could get a bit of money from one last job; one where he didn't even have to be careful about getting caught. But that clearly didn't work out so well.

I've stashed a few things at his place more than once, and he knows a lot more about the ring than I do.

It's a relatively new settlement. Some great-great-grandmother of mine set up a small farmstead here after the War of the Usurper, when most of the countryside was in ruins and the rebuilding city of Anvil was in dire need of reliable local food sources. Over time other farmers moved here and it became known as Marav, probably named after the goddess. Eventually, about sixty years ago or so, it was deemed important enough to be recognized by the crown as a proper village and assigned a Reeve -- my father.

In addition, many smaller wineries make their own wine and skip the illustrious names. Colovian battlewine is wine fortified with juniper liquor.

> INFO.NAME akul 8862008109083316
Akul is a popular and affordable ale. Its most distinguishing feature is the addition of a small amount of mandrake essence, which gives it a unique flavor. Mandrakes aren't grown commercially around here, so we have to source them from foragers in and around the Dasek Marsh, where they grow wild. Luckily, a single mandrake root is enough for several batches of akul.
###

> INFO.NAME akul 293214749277877601
Akul is ale brewed from malted wheat and flavored with a tiny amount of mandrake extract. It's a cheap and relatively weak drink, and a staple of many a laborer's diet. That doesn't mean that it won't get you intoxicated if you drink too much of it, though. In large amounts akul will make you feel like you're strong enough to wrestle a bear, and it'll also make you dumb enough to think that you should try.

Great. Wya should be somewhere around here. Get her to come back here when you find her.
###

You don't want the gold? Are you some sort of monk? Well, I'm sure you'll change your mind.

What? Wya's dead? I -- I need some time alone, %PCName.
###

She's my wife, although you'd never guess it from how she acts. She should have a train of servants following her at all times. But no, she insists on solitude. I've no clue where she's gotten off to now. Go look for her, won't you? I've got a bag of coin for you if you find her and bring her back to me.
###

I'll find her.

I didn't see Lady Barettius leave the Abecette.

Yes. I think I saw her here. Feel free to look around.

If she's here, she should be on the balcony overlooking the pit.

Lady Wya Barettius? I did see here come through here. It looked like she was heading for the fight pit downstairs.

Sorry, but %Name hasn't seen her come through here. Maybe she's at one of the gambling tables in the back.

Thank you again, %PCName. Kod may just be one amongst the herd, but he's still my responsibility, you know?
###

> INFO.NAME kod 387262341894818774
Kod is dead? I feared as much, truthfully. Thank you for telling me. I unfortunately can't give you any reward. I need to save my coin to cover the loss.
###

> INFO.NAME kod 57403432220922283
It's Kod! Thank you. You saved me a lot of headache here. I don't have much, but I promised a reward. I hope some gold and some of my products are enough for all the trouble you went though.
###

> INFO.NAME kod 228442636285338290
You actually did it? Hah! That herder won't know a thing. I promised a little trinket for you. I don't really know what it is, something old, kind of shiny. But you can have it. As for us? We're gonna find a nice and comfy spot in our cave for Kod.
###

Please make sure you use Command Creature to bring him back calmly, or else he'll just run off again.

Then what're you standing around there for!?
###

Yeah, yeah, you know the deal with Kod. We're practically dying of thirst, y'know! We get the 'al-e-you', and you get to walk away with our dear friend. You got the drink with you?
###

Yes, here it is.
###

No, I'm working on it.
###

> INFO.NAME kod 2568316745140814628
Hah! You wanna make a deal? We'd be pretty sad with Kod gone, y'know. We'd need something nice and tasty. Something that could get us drunk, and take our minds off of the loss of a dear friend. Get us something called... 'al-e-you', I think? Maybe we'd forget all about our friend if we're in a stupor! Do it quickly, too. The longer you wait, the more attached we'll become to dear, sweet Kod!
###

> INFO.NAME kod 21795139762758128605
Really, that easy? Not gonna fight us about it? Tell you what, if you go back and tell the man looking for Kod that he got eaten by a beast, or something, I'll give you something in return. A nice little shiny that I dug up in our cave. We'll stay here and keep hanging out while you do that.
###

That's right. Leave us alone.
###

Are you dull? I've already told you, you're not taking Kod. Try anything and I'll cleave your head open.

Eh? Is that this goat's name? Well, 'Kod' has become an important part of our group, y'know? Me and the idiot over there. I know why you wanna take him. Men raise goats like little babes, only to slaughter them for meat and skin. Don't you think that's a little disturbing? It's like eating your kids! So, nah, we're not giving you Kod. He's our friend now. So go away! Get the hell out of my face!

That's the buck's name, remember? He's most likely wandered somewhere between the ruins of Fort Swordmoth, and the Ayleid ruin of Gulaida, further east of the fort. They can both be found if you head east along the Gold Road. If he's alive, I'd appreciate it if you could lure him back to me. Please, make sure he's calm when you do. Cast or use a scroll of Command Creature on him. If instead you only find carrion, then I'd at least like to know his fate.
###

> INFO.NAME kod 173802358587532522
Thank you. Kod's probably wandered somewhere near those ruins I kept away from. An Ayleid tower by the name of Gulaida, and the ruins of Fort Swordmoth. They're both eastward along the Gold Road, so keep a look out for a goat between those two areas. All I need you to do is lure him back to me, and lure him back calmly. He's easily riled up around strangers. Use something like a Command Creature scroll to make him follow you. I'll reward you as best I can. If you find him dead, I'd like to know as well.
###

Lya hasn't decided how to vote. She oversees the Company's operations in Hammerfell, and her main issue with the acquisition is the effect it could have on our relationships with Redguard salt exporters. I'm thinking that you might be able to consult the So-Mitana Company, a big Hammerfell company with a branch in Charach. When they say that the deal would affect their own exports -- and they will -- you can tell Lya that she was right. It'll probably be enough to make her oppose the acquisition.
