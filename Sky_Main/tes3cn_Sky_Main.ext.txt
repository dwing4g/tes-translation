Liminal Bridges<BR>
By Camilonwe of Alinor<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
A Discourse On The Theory and Praxis of Travelling Between Mundus and Oblivion<BR> 
<BR>
Transliminal passage of quickened objects or entities without the persistent agency of hyperagonal media is not possible, and even if possible, would result in instantaneous retromission of the transported referents. Only a transpontine circumpenetra- tion of the limen will result in transits of greater than infinitessimal duration.<BR>
<BR>
Though other hyperagonal media may exist in theory, the only known transliminal artifact capable of sustained transpontine circumpenetra- tion is the sigil stone. A sigil stone is a specimen of pre-Mythic quasi-crystalline morpholith that has been transformed into an extra-dimensional artifact through the arcane inscription of a daedric sigil. Though some common morpholiths like soul gems may be found in nature, the exotic morpoliths used to make sigil stones occur only in pocket voids of Oblivion, and cannot be prospected or harvested without daedric assistance.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, since both the morpholiths and the daedric sigils required for hyperagonal media cannot be obtained without traffic and commerce with Daedra Lords, it is necessary that a transliminal mechanic cultivate a working knowledge of conjuration -- though purpose-built enchantments may be substituted if the mechanic has sufficient invocatory skill. Traffic and commerce with Daedra Lords is an esoteric but well-established practice, and lies outside the compass of this treatise. [1]<BR>
<BR>
Presuming a sigil stone has been acquired, the transliminal mechanic must first prepare the morpholith to receive the daedric sigil.<BR>
<BR>
Let the mechanic prepare a chamber, sealed against all daylight and disturbances of the outer air, roofed and walled with white stone and floored with black tiles. All surfaces of this chamber must be ritually purified with a solution of void salts in ether solvent.<BR>
<BR>
A foursquare table shall be placed in the center of the room, with a dish to receive the morpholith. Four censers shall be prepared with incense compounded from gorvix and harrada. On the equinox, the mechanic shall then place the morpolith in the dish and intone the rites of the Book of Law, beginning at dawn and continuing without cease until the sunset of the same day.<BR>
<BR>
The mechanic may then present the purified morpholith to the Daedra Lord for his inscription. Once inscribed with the Daedra Lord's sigil, the morpholith becomes a true sigil stone, a powerful artifact that collects and stores arcane power -- similar in many respects to a charged soul gem, but of a much greater magnitude. And it is this sigil stone that is required to provide the tremendous arcane power necessary to sustain the enchantment that supports the transpontine circumpenetration of the limen.<BR>
<BR>
To open a gate to Oblivion, the mechanic must communicate directly, by spell or enchantment, with the Daedra Lord who inscribed the sigil stone in question. The Daedra Lord and the mechanic jointly invoke the conjurational charter [2], and the mechanic activates the charged sigil stone, which is immediately transported through the liminal barrier to the spot where its sigil was inscribed, thus opening a temporary portal between Mundus and Oblivion. This portal may only remain open for a brief period of time, depending on the strength of the liminal barrier at the chosen spots, several minutes being the longest ever reported, so the usefulness of such a gate is quite limited.<BR>
<BR>
[1] Interested students are invited to consult the works of Albrecht Theophannes Bombidius and Galerion The Mystic for the fundaments of this discipline.
[2] Recommended examples of the conjurational charter may be found in Therion's Book of Most Arcane Covenants or Ralliballah's Eleven Ritual Forms.<BR>

Where the fool Azra saw only rote transcription, I see the Truth of Shadow. The choice of the mortal on a single one of these strands matters not a whit, but the choice of the mortal on all of them at once can shake the very foundations of existence.
<BR>I choose to make the only choice that matters. The only choice that can ever matter. To cut through the veil-cloth that separates Here from There and Then from Now and declare that there is no difference. I shall claw back the power of reality from the ruinous light, and with the Umbra'Keth at my side I shall do what even Azra never dreamed possible.<BR>

De Rerum Dirennis<BR>
by Vorian Direnni<BR><BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR><BR>
I am six-hundred-and-eleven years old. I have never had children of my own, but I have many nieces and nephews and cousins who have been raised with the tales and traditions of our ancient, illustrious, and occasionally notorious clan, the Direnni. Few families in Tamriel can boast so many famous figures, wielding so much power over the fate of so many. Our warriors and kings are stuff of legend, and it is not to dismiss their honor and their achievements to say you have heard quite enough about them.<BR>
<BR>
I myself have never picked up a sword or written an important law, but I am part of a lesser known but still important Direnni tradition: the way of the wizard. My own autobiography would be of little interest to posterity - though my nephew, nieces, and cousins indulge me to tell wild tales of life in the chaotic Second Era of Tamriel - but I have a few ancestors whose stories should be told. They may have changed history as we know it as dramatically as my better known relatives, but their names are in danger of being forgotten.<BR>
<BR>
Most recently, Lysandus, the King of Daggerfall, was able to conquer his ancient enemies of Sentinel in part thanks to his court sorceress, Medora Direnni. Her grandfather Jovron Direnni was Imperial Battlemage to the court of the Dunmer Empress of Tamriel, Katariah, assisting her in creating peace in a time of turmoil. His great great grandfather Pelladil Direnni had a similar role with the first Potentate, and encouraged the Guild Act without which we would not have all the professional organizations we have today. His ancestor, many times back, was the witch Raven Direnni, who with her better known cousins Aiden and Ryain, brought an end to the tyranny of the latter Alessian Empire. Before the Psijics of Artaeum, it is said, she created the art of enchantment, learning how to bind a soul into a gem and use that to ensorcel all manners of weaponry.<BR>
<BR>
But it is the story of an ancestor even more ancient, more distant than Raven I wish to tell.<BR>
<BR>
Asliel Direnni harkens back to the humble beginnings of our clan, in the tiny farming village of Tyrigel on the banks of the river Caomus which was then called the Diren, hence the family name. Like all on Summurset Isle in those days, he was a simple planter of the fields. But while others only grew enough to sustain their immediate kin, even distant cousins of the Dirennis worked together. They would decide as a group which fields were best for wheat, orchard, vine, livestock, or apiary, and thereby always have the best yields of any farm which worked alone, doing the best as it could with what it had.<BR>
<BR>
Asliel had a particularly poor farm for most kind of agriculture, but small herbs found its stony, loamless, acidic soil very comfortable. Out of necessity more than anything else he became an expert on all manners of herbs. For the most part, of course, they were used in flavoring cooking, but as you know, hardly any plant grows on the surface of our world without a magickal potential.<BR>
<BR>
Even so long ago, witches already were in existence. It would be ridiculous for me to suggest that Asliel Direnni invented alchemy. What he did, what we can all be grateful for, is that he formulated it into an art and science.<BR>
<BR>
There were no witches' covens in Tyrigel, and, of course, there would be no Mages Guild yet for thousands of years, so people would come to him for cures. He learned for himself the exact formula for combining black lichen and roobrush to create a cure for all manners of poison, and the amount of willow anther to crush and mix with chokeweed to cure diseases.<BR>
<BR>
There were few much greater threats in Tyrigel in those peaceful days than disease or accidental poisonings. Yes, there were some dark forces in the wilderness, trolls, chimera, the occasional malevolent fairy folk and Will-O-The-Wisp, but even the youngest, most foolish Altmer knew how to avoid them. There were, however, a few unusual threats which Asliel had a hand in defeating.<BR>
<BR>
One of the tales told of him that I believe to be true is how he was brought a young niece who had been suffering from an unknown disease. Despite his ministrations, she grew weaker and weaker every morning. Finally, he gave her a bitter tasting drink, and the next morning, ashes were found all around her bed. A vampire had been feeding on the poor girl, but Asliel's potion had turned her very blood into poison, without harming her in the least.<BR>
<BR>
If only this formula had not been lost in the mists of history!<BR>
<BR>
This would have been enough to make him a minor but significant figure in the annals of early Summurset, but at that point in history, a barbarian tribe called the Locvar had found their way down the Diren River, and recognized Tyrigel as a rich target for raids. The Direnni, not being warriors yet but simple farmers, were helpless and could only flee and watch the Locvar take the best of their crops, raid after raid.<BR>
<BR>
Asliel, however, had been experimenting with the vampire dust, and brought his cousins to him with a plan. The next time the Locvar were sighted on the Diren, the word went out and all the most able-bodied came to Asliel's laboratory. When the barbarians arrived in Tyrigel, they found the farms deserted, and assumed that all had fled as usual. As they set about stealing the bounty, they suddenly found themselves under attack by invisible forces. Believing the Direnni farms to be haunted, they ran away very quickly.<BR>
<BR>
They attempted a few more raids, for their greed would always eventually overpower their fear, and each time, they were set upon by attackers who they could not see. As barbaric as they were, they were not stupid, and they changed their mind about the source of their defeat. It could not be that the farms were haunted, because the crops were still being tended and harvested, and the animals seemed to show no fear. The Locvar decided to send a scout to the farm to see if he could spy their secrets.<BR>
<BR>
The scout sent word back to the Locvar that the Direnni farms were populated with flesh and blood, entirely visible Altmer. He continued to watch as his barbarian cohorts moved down the river, and he saw the elderly and children flee for the hills, while the able-bodied farmers and their wives went to Asliel's laboratory. He saw them go in; he saw no one come out.<BR>
<BR>
As usual, the Locvar were repelled by invisible forces, but their scout soon told them what he saw happening in the laboratory.<BR>
<BR>
The next night, two of the Locvar approached Asliel's farm very stealthily, and managed to kidnap him without alerting the rest of the Direnni. The Locvar chieftain, knowing that the farmers could no longer count on the alchemist to make them invisible, considered an immediate attack on the farms. But he was a vengeful sort, and felt he had been humiliated by these simple farmers. A crafty plan emerged in his mind. What if the Direnni, who always saw his barbarian tribe coming, for once did not? Imagine the slaughter if no one even had a chance to flee.<BR>
<BR>
The scout had told the chieftain that Asliel had used the dust of a vampire to make the farmers invisible, but he was not sure what the other ingredient had been. He described an incandescent powder that Asliel had mixed into the dust. Asliel, of course, refused to help the Locvar, but they were experts in torture as well as pillage, and he knew he would have to talk or die.<BR>
<BR>
Finally after hours of torture, he agreed to tell them what the incandescent powder was. He did not know the name, but he called it "Glow Dust," the only remains of a slain Will O The Wisp. He told them they would need a lot of it if they wanted to turn the whole tribe invisible for the raid.<BR>
<BR>
The Locvar grumbled that not only did they have to find and kill a vampire to attain his dust, but find and kill several Will O The Wisps to get theirs. In a few days time, they came back with the ingredients the alchemist asked for. The chieftain, not being a complete idiot, made Asliel taste the potion first. He did as he was told and turned invisible, demonstrating that it did truly work. The chieftain put him to work creating more. No one apparently noticed that while he did, he was nibbling on black lichen and roobrush.<BR>
<BR>
The Locvar took the potion as he doled it out, and soon, but not too soon that they didn't suffer, they were all dead.<BR>
<BR>
The scout who had seen Asliel mixing the invisibility potion had apparently mistook the glow of the candlelight in the laboratory for an incandescence which the second ingredient of the invisibility potion did not possess. The second ingredient was actually dull, simple redwort, one of the most common herbs in Tamriel. When they had insisted during torture that Asliel tell them what the incandescent powder was, Asliel remembered that he had once experimentally mixed glow dust and vampire dust together once and created a powerful poison. It was simple enough to steal a little redwort from the barbarian's camp, mix that with the vampire and glow dust mixture, and create a potion that was in fact an invisibility poison. After curing himself, he gave the poison to the barbarians.<BR>
<BR>
The Locvar, being dead, never again raided the Direnni farms, and having no other enemies, they were able to grow more and more prosperous and powerful. Generations later, they left Summurset and began their historic adventures on the Tamriel mainland. Asliel Direnni, because of his excellence as an alchemist, was invited to Artaeum and became a Psijic. It is not known how many more of the common formulas we know today were invented by him there, but I have no doubt, the science and art of alchemy as we know it today would not exist without him.<BR>
<BR>
But that is all in the distant past. Asliel's innovations, like my modest ones, like the achievements of the Dirennis throughout history, are but a stepping stone to the wonders which will come in the future. I wish I could be there to witness them, but if I can only share some of the past with the children of Direnni and the children of Tamriel, then I will consider my life well spent. <BR>

To whoever finds this.<BR>
<BR>
I hope you didn't make the same mistake I did, falling into this cursed hole without any levitation potions in my sack. I don't know how long I've been here, the cursed darkness has made me lose track of day and night. Has it been days? Months? At least my enchanted lantern has kept me sane. No one's been here other than spikeworms and all sorts of crawly, nasty things. I'm afraid these might be my last words, and that I'll never see the sun, or my home, again..<BR>
<BR>
I think the date is around the 14th of Hearthfire, but I might be wrong. At least I know it's the 397th year of the Third Era, and that I'm somewhere near the city of Karthwasten, or at least what's left of it. All too far from my childhood streets in Daggerfall.<BR>
<BR>
I think the war is over, but one can hardly tell. Travelling through the ruins of the Reach, the evidence of war is gruesome. Everywhere there are signs of warfare. Entire cities put to the torch, either by soldiers or opportunistic raiders. The dead or dying line the roads. Wherever you go, black smoke fills your lungs.<BR>
<BR>
The chaos has turned every Man, Elf or Beast against one another. Not even the roads are safe anymore, and the commoners calling to the Legion for help are met with a deafening silence. Everywhere there are brigands and warbands plundering the scraps that were left from the conquest and battle. Last I heard, there still was fighting in Dragonstar. Karthwasten fell before my eyes, and the Nords have already enacted brutal force in their new regime. I snuck my way out with a group of Redguards I had befriended during my stay in the city. But after crossing the Karth and making our way into the forest to hide, we were set upon by a gang of marauders, and I fled into these cursed caves.<BR>
<BR>
Stranger, once again I hope you won't share my fate. If you manage to get out of here alive, I hope you will cherish each day you have left in Tamriel. I don't know if it is still there, but I buried some of my valuables behind the Dancing Saber tavern when the Nord armies approached, and I didn't have time to get them when we fled. They're yours, if they are still there. To find them, walk straight out of the backdoor until you reach the city walls. Then turn directly left, and walk 15 steps along the wall. If no one's found them yet, they should be there. The key to the chest is in my sack.<BR>
<BR>
If you're ever in Daggerfall, please say hello to Beledrion, the old High Elf. He's probably still doing his rounds in the gardens. Good luck, stranger.<BR>

An Unreasonable Request
###

A strange Nord calling himself Kjalmar the Unreasonable has asked me to bring him something useful.
###

> INFO.NAME sky_qre_dh1_journal 2288514215639918719
When pressed about finding something useful, Kjalmar specified that I should bring him back a Magus Console from the Angturiel ruins. He implied it would be quite heavy.
###

> INFO.NAME sky_qre_dh1_journal 1954512612144665242
Although the Magus Console in Angturiel was indeed too heavy to lift, I was able to retrieve a small, strange disc from within it. Perhaps Kjalmar will accept this as something useful, instead.
###

I seem to have displeased Kjalmar, and he has attacked me.

I met a Reachman huntress named Kenovi who was captured by the Bear Clan at the Blood Paw Lodge. Kenovi believes her family will attack the lodge to rescue her, but she wants peace.

You think I destroyed that poor village? I never would have done such a thing. Besides, I was still dead. Or was I? At any rate, I was certainly in no condition to go around destroying villages with shadow magic. I daresay it was that twisted wretch Pergan Asuul. He committed many such atrocities after he abandoned my guidance.
###

> INFO.NAME shadowmage 82737875420017505
Nobody knows. Both Haimtir and Blencath were destroyed soon after by the Nords. Some believed that the mage died in Blencath when the town burned, but my mother never believed that. He was a dark sorcerer on a mission, she said, and no warband could have stood before his power. Blencath is still an empty ruin to this day, and I cannot say where the mage could have gone from there.
###

> INFO.NAME shadowmage 309779972597718937
Yes, I told you my mother's tale. I've never seen anything like that myself, and I dearly hope I never do.
###

> INFO.NAME shadowmage 2578119544685523661
Yes, I know about him. He came through Haimtir in the latter days of the war, when my mother lived here. He was a great angry wretch of a man, in her telling, all scarred and twisted by his strange magicks, and cloaked in a great shroud made of darkness. When the mage left Haimtir, my mother knew it was a portent of destruction to come, so she too left town. But she swore to me that he cackled and chanted as he fled northwest towards Blencath, the very air around him crackling with darkness.
###

What happened to the mage after that?
###

Many things %Name knows. But this thing is beyond %Name's knowings. Reesha can tell a tale for %PCName, hm? Very close she lives, here in Haimtir. But how does it start? And how does it end? If answers are not found atop the mesa, then perhaps below it, yes? This one thinks so.

###

Rumors and hearsay are all I can offer on that subject, I'm afraid. To hear the common folk tell it, there were dozens of these mages operating all over the Reach. But I've never come across confirmed reports of any such foolishness.
###

Are you still expelled? Then we will not talk about this.
###

Then you must return to Criaglorc, %PCRank. Find out what happened to the Penumbra, and recover it, if you can. I cannot emphasize enough the danger of potent shadow magic in the wrong hands.
###

> INFO.NAME shadowmage 4402234191386332537
Before the Umbra'Keth emerged, there were reports of strange occurrences throughout the borderlands. Mysterious disappearances, mass memory loss, pitch darkness in daylight -- all phenomena consistent with what we know of shadow magic. Many who have studied the Simulacrum believe that these early anomalies were caused by mages operating in secret, performing rituals to grow their powers in order to summon the Umbra'Keth. It is possible that Ruari was a victim of one such ritual.
###

> INFO.BNAM shadowmage 4402234191386332537 c1
I've heard of the Umbra'Keth. When the the Braign Reachmen asked me to collect a magic stone called the Penumbra, their matriarch said the stone was 'borne of the Umbra'Keth'.
###

> INFO.NAME shadowmage 104661342089819690
There are stranger things in Oblivion and Mundus, %PCName, than you could possibly dream. The Umbra'Keth was no daedra. It drew its power from shadow magic, a little-understood and extremely dangerous form of magic that exerts a massive physical and mental price from its wielders... And its victims.
###

> INFO.BNAM shadowmage 104661342089819690 c1
What does any of this have to do with Ruari?
###

> INFO.NAME shadowmage 10112150762487830160
For a time, the monster was said to have its lair in a temple in Hammerfell. But as the bloodshed increased, its hunger drew it to the Crypt of Hearts in High Rock. It was there that the creature was finally destroyed, and its powers of shadow with it.
###

What does any of this have to do with Ruari?
###

> INFO.NAME shadowmage 232473157235355862
During the War of Bend'r-Mahk, a monstrous shadow demon called the Umbra'Keth stalked the borderlands between Skyrim, Hammerfell, and High Rock. No one knows where it came from, but it was said that the abomination drew its strength from the ferocity of the war in the Reach. This is how it became known by its more common name: the Shadow of Conflict. The more brutal the war grew, the more powerful the Umbra'Keth became.
###

The last thing I remember, a mage with a ruined face appeared in the middle of the village. He appeared as if from nowhere, stepping through a... hole in the air, dark as the maw of Satakal. I called for Saram, and he began to run towards me, but the void cut a swathe of black between us. I relived that moment a thousand times, and yet each seemed as real as the first.

Haimtir is a small village. Not much happens here. We are mostly farmers and herders, making a living on the Briag Cnoss mesa. There used to be other villages neaby, but the war took care of that. We don't have much, but we get by. The local Reachman tribe, the Pachkan, are a friendly lot. You shouldn't worry about them. They mostly gather at their Great Hallowhall to sing, drink, worship and mourn their dead. Orcs also visit to worship their god, Trinimac.

A missing caravan, you say? From Ildos Norvor in Karthwasten... He's that unlucky Dark Elf, right? Hm, I can't say we've seen any of his wagons pass through here recently. If it's gone missing, someone must have taken it off the road between here and Karthwasten. The land off the road is full of rocky outcrops and hollows. I'd suggest searching the area. Just watch yourself if you think some outlaws expect you to come looking for it.

The road to Hammerfell goes out the south gate, up along the cliffs and through Vorngyd's Stand, a small border fort. I want you to track down my wagon and secure it, though the raiders have probably already taken anything on it for themselves. If you can find evidence of Rolic Gilded-Shield being involved, all the better. Return to me when you've done both, with the location of the caravan, and maybe the gold the Fighters Guild asked for won't have been spent completely in vain.

Of course he would be too clever to use his own household mercenaries in such a brazen attack. The men who jumped my caravan must have been some thugs he picked up just for the job.

Seeing that I could not be defeated, Druabith gathered up all the blood magic she had accrued in her "Sun Mother" guise and conjured these great pillars from the ground to confine me. And here I remain trapped, though not without considerable power. I whispered to my daughter in her dreams, and led her here to found Bailcnoss as a sanctuary of the White Moon. Now I speak to every Matriarch, shaping the fates of the Taliesinn and gathering my Chosen to my side.

I inducted the other witch-warriors of the tribe into a new cult, and spread what I now saw as my gift to them. They are my Chosen, and their ranks are filled with the strongest Taliesinn of each generation. But not all accepted the White Moon, and Druabith's devoted turned on me. The strongest of them pursued me, much as my own coven had my progenitor, but unlike that weakling I slew them all. The greatest of their number hangs behind me still.

Once I was simply Malthorc, revered witch-warrior of the Taliesinn. During a hunt, the warriors of my coven ran down a wereboar who had stalked the tribe for weeks. But it was stronger than we expected, and in its death throes it spread its curse to my body. Once I had been devoted to that hag Druabith and her Sun Cult, but now I felt the White Moon call to me and began to shun the sunlight.

The Moon Cult is not what they told us! The Chosen belong to Malthorc, body and soul. Seek the entrance to Taliesinntara, under the village, in the sacred depths among stone and water... That is where He resides. He tells me... He wants you to seek Him out. He says that Fhegain, in the village, is your only obstacle.

And now we come to your role in this. I believe the Moon Cult in Bailcnoss was responsible for Saorai's death. You must uncover the nature of the Cult's rituals and what they are planning for us. Travel to Alrasaide cavern, by the only pine tree north of Bailcnoss, and return when you know how Saorai died. If you need further advice, bring me more components for a ritual. I will use them to channel the Sun Mother and seek her counsel on your behalf.

But the Moon Cult remained restless, and soon the warrior's own daughter declared herself matriarch of the Taliesinn. In the division that followed, the Moon Cult was expelled from Merduibh and left to found Bailcnoss. We have existed in a fractious peace ever since. I am worried that the Moon Cult has some responsibility for Saorai's death, and that we may soon find ourselves in conflict. We bleed and bleed ourselves, but the Mother still only gives me partial visions of what may come.

It was at the height of our power that the insidious influence of the White Moon began to snake through the Taliesinn, and the Mother's favor waned as fewer and fewer of us would give of our blood. The Moon Cultists were led by a revered witch-warrior of the tribe who turned many Taliesinn away from the light of the Sun. When the warrior, at the height of the summer solstice, seized the matriarch's newborn and devoured it before the whole tribe, he was driven from Merduibh.

But before we look to the future, we must reflect upon the past.

We gave of our blood, and in return She gave us prosperity and the power to resist the lottchach invaders. The Sun shone upon us and all was well.

Self-experimentation has been my source of learning so far and my most recent foray was into Conjuration. After casting one particular spell, I found myself transported hours into the future. I then realized that my body traveled somewhere with my notes, which I absolutely must find. I believe that if I were to repeat the experiment, I would likely retrace my original steps. All I need is a volunteer to escort me to the hiding place and then dispel the effects of the spell. Will you help me?

A bookseller on the other side of the wall -- you might have run into him already, for all I know. But citizens are worried about the strange sounds and lights coming from his shop at night, and take him for a conjurer of Daedra. The Mages Guild Charter gives us authority over unlicensed practice of magic, so use that authority to find out whether these accusations have any truth.

Thank you so much, %PCName. Conall is almost certainly with the Norr woman, Lisva, he was always talking about. He said she visited the Nukra Tikil Tavern in Dragonstar West. Please go there and bring him back. If he is hiding, ask her for information.

I guess I have to trust you. I witnessed one of the Dur-Gada slitting the throat of some traveling merchant near the Crown Palace, back when I lived on the other side of the city. I started getting threats after I reported it to the guards, so I fled across the wall and took over the Herbarium after Penelope died. I think they're trying to frame me as one of their agents. In fact, I think Razhab might be one of them.

Corelyn is a Bosmer robber living in the house next door. She refuses to join the guild, and her amateur purse-lifting is drawing unwanted attention to our own operations. Her recent botched burglary of a nobleman's manor was the final straw. Do whatever it takes, short of murder, to get her out of our hair.

These are the three principal gods of the Nords. Kyne, goddess of the storm, sits at the head of the pantheon and vents her fury against the killers of Shor. Mara, goddess of the family, serves as handmaiden to Kyne and acts as a gentler authority to the Nords. Dibella, goddess of love and beauty, chooses to direct her attentions elsewhere -- toward teachings of pleasure and the things that make life worth living. Ha!

Bodja is a sweet, lightly alcoholic drink brewed at mountain monasteries. It is made from sweet, fermented yak-milk, and mixed with a number of hardy mountain herbs. The savory result is a thick, hearty drink that keeps your stomach full and your blood flowing. Bodja is considered a mountaineering staple, and pilgrims traversing the high roads often keep a horn among their supplies.

We are the Bears of the Reach, famous for our heroes. Greatest of them was Rigmad Bear-Hand, who first drove the Elf-Men from the Karth's riverbanks. Then came the great hero Forl Bear-Claw, who proved his worth by wrestling the very beasts that lend our clan its name. And who could forget the hunter Korljal Karth-Man, who with his spear, did pierce the heart of the Kraljdasrall, a demon Minotaur summoned by foul Reachmen.

Take the nimhnana and pour it onto the sacks of picked wheat. The sacks are in a crate, marked for delivery, in the covered outbuilding in the northwest corner of Haimtir. And do not worry -- it is not a true poison. A stomach upset, that is all it causes. The only true harm will be to Farkon's profits, when no one wants to buy his wheat any more. And then he will be poor and foolish also.

Whilst our race has a proud way of war, spilling blood needlessly is for bandits, not proud Orcs. As long as I am chief of the Nargozh, we will travel and trade instead of roam and pillage. Be wary approaching other camps, for there exist some Orcs who choose that lesser path.

The Sogat Dur-Gada continue to strike out against Nordic forces across the Reach. A cell is rumored to exist in tunnels under Karthwasten, but violence is most prevalent in Dragonstar. Jarl Jona is cracking down on her side of the divided city, Dragonstar East, with an iron fist. Meanwhile, bandits and Reachmen are becoming bolder in their raiding of caravans.

> INFO.NAME talos 364332268522929754
Talos is another mighty Ysmir, exalted by Shor to deliver us from the elves, and as a great Nordic hero we mark his totem to keep the spirit of his enterprise alive. Some amongst us are inclined to see him as a new god -- a twilight god -- though whether one of destruction or salvation we do not yet know.
###

> INFO.NAME talos 907811340157452347
None of these have satisfying answers, I'm afraid, and Talos has yet to find a place in the mythic cycle. But look around as you travel Skyrim, and you'll notice just how many things the Nords mark with his totem. After all, he might as well be the god of that too.
###

> INFO.NAME talos 5998139021893832396
Is this southern dragon some aspect of Alduin, or a new god entirely? What is his relationship to Wulfharth, the venerated avatar of Shor? Could Talos in fact be Shor himself, reborn into this world and leading the Nords to eternal subjugation of the elves?

Talos is a tricky one, and the Nords themselves seem quite unsure what to make of him. To some he is mere nonsense, and to others he is simply some new export of the Imperial Cult. But to the more curious and contemplative Nord, Talos represents a significant break in their religious thought.

To give themselves an alibi, the Khajiit have locked up the warehouse and moved out. That means locked doors you'll need to get through, but it also means no guards on the inside. The brothers themselves have moved into the Dragon Fountain Inn, so if you're thinking of swiping the key then that's where I'd look. Good luck, %PCName.
###

So they need a professional -- that's you. The target is a locked chest in the basement vault where the most valuable items are kept. You bring the contents of that chest to me, we fence the contents, take our cut, and deliver the rest to the brothers. You can take whatever else you want from the warehouse, on top of your payment after the job is done. Pretty good deal, eh? It gets better.

You have the contents of the chest? That's impressive, %PCName. Drazar and J'Rizar are telling the story to the guards by now, I imagine. We will wait until things die down a bit and then fence these. Drazar and J'Rizar will head out of town in the meantime and wait for us to deliver their cut.

The chest is on the bottom floor of the warehouse, inside the locked vault. The only keys belong to J'Rizar and Drazar, and they open the warehouse doors, the vault, and the chest. You can take whatever you want from the warehouse but bring the contents of the locked chest to me.
###

Drazar and J'Rizar want to cash out of the business and retire to the Bountylands around Riverhold. Bully for them, I say, and what's more they've just taken possession of a chest they believe contains something very valuable. Problem is, if they just take the wares themselves and call it a theft, they have the only keys and are therefore implicated.

Fantastic work, %PCRank! She's already arrived. I'm so glad our Guild chapter is finally growing once again.

Davanna Evamain is a mage of some renown living in Karthwasten. She had some sort of falling out with the Guild there -- I'm not sure what, exactly -- but perhaps she will be amenable to joining us here in Dragonstar. Someone of her prestige will surely boost our perception amongst the locals. Do what it takes to recruit her, %PCRank.

Oh, thank the Gods. I was hoping to make more of a success at things here than at that terrible old Guild. Little could I have known Geod would send someone to kill me over it. Here, take this -- it's a key to my old stash at the Karthwasten Guild. It's got some loot in it from the supply chest, plus a little extra.

Frinad is probably somewhere in Gilded-Shield's manor to the east. Go south out of town, take the road east, then head to the northeast. Be careful -- hitting him in there surrounded by Rolic's mercenaries would be stupid. Frinad's an archer, so fighting him up close is the way to get him.

My brother Kovko ran away from the Nords, but I have no doubt that he has returned with Drydo, my uncle. I do not want to leave if it will cause violence. Please tell Drydo that I will not assist him if he comes here to fight.

Here in Dragonstar East, the Shadowkey Tavern has beds, food, and drinks. You can also find many shops on the main road. Malrec Mascarde the Bookseller, Secucius Ceria the Pawnbroker and Yael the Trader come to mind. Oh, and the Orc smith Lurohk gra-Nagazh has a forge by the walls. Ildgar's Alehouse is across from the Arena. You can find other services at Taurus Hall outside town. Or visit the Great Bazaar in Dragonstar West.

You should start at the Blood Paw Lodge -- it's a hunting camp that straddles some of the paths on that side of the forest. The lodge is just northwest of Karthgad. If you end up at the Bear Clan ancestral barrow, you're on the wrong road. Hope that helps. Just look after yourself out there.

Alright, save your gold. Let me offer my opinion. At a guess, if they've fled into the Vorndgad they'll be sticking to the mesa cliff lines. The cliffs shelter you from the weather and it's more defensible than an open forest position. Probably on the western side of the forest, too, away from the major towns like Markarth.

But I guess you want some scouting advice, huh? I'd help you find those Orcs, but I'm not really feeling it at the moment. I do love establishing relationships, especially with a fellow member. Some gold would go a long way towards building ours.

Rissoc said WHAT? That liar needs to study his metaphysics. The only way to fit objects into spaces they shouldn't fit is by removing them from Mundus and putting them in another plane, obviously. The extra cloth came from Oblivion, and Rissoc isn't going to profit from my good fortune.

The extra bolts clearly came from Oblivion, and I'd rather send them back to the Void than hand them over to that greedy scoundrel.

Indeed. I know that scheming miscreant who was my carriage-guard was dabbling in the arcane. I saw him plucking magical lights from his fingers every night across the campfire.

I hire all sorts of questionable characters in my line of work. The best way to keep your goods safe from rogues and scoundrels is to have a few rogues and scoundrels of your own in your employ. But this carriage-guard, he was uniquely untrustworthy. A conniving little man with a flinty eye and a dagger as sharp as his tongue, he made more trouble than he was worth wherever we went. I never trusted him, and to tell the truth I was somewhat relieved at his death. Now I feel justified in that relief.

I'm afraid Pelbelle is sorely misunderstanding the situation. I don't want the extra cloth for myself; I want to return them to the Falkreath weaver who is surely missing them.

Thank you for coming to me first. My trade is my pride, and I am an honest merchant.

Unluckily for him -- and me, it seems -- that carriage-guard was killed in a tavern brawl before we departed, and I did not know of the extra bolts until I heard the tale here. I must return those bolts of cloth to Falkreath with my apologies, or surely my reputation will be ruined.

Well, that's somewhat disappointing. I had hoped that the advice of the Mages Guild could settle this case definitively. No matter.

Last week, a traveling merchant named Rissoc sold a case of fabric to a Karthwasten garment seller named Pelbelle Tiralese. Pelbelle let it slip that she received far more fabric than she paid for, and soon the rumor reached Rissoc -- who wants the extra cloth back. On its surface, the situation seems like a simple case of confusion, but both parties insist magic was involved. This is why I requested that the Mages Guild take a look at things. Please speak to Rissoc and Pelbelle Tiralese, and return to me.

So the Concordat was signed, recognizing Nord rule over the eastern city, and establishing the dividing wall. Of course, as you surely know, the war did reach Dragonstar in the end. Tragically, more fighting did take place in the eastern city when the armies of the Reach arrived. The subsequent Treaty of Chorrol confirmed the cession of County Karthwasten to Skyrim, and the Kings of Markarth have ruled Karthwasten and Dragonstar East to this day.

It has kept the peace in Dragonstar for thirty years. In fact, the Concordat is the reason this wall exists. It was the product of a swift intervention by the ever-vigilant Imperial Legion, who were forced to impose a peace when the Nords of Dragonstar rose up against the Crown Redguards and began warring with them. The War of the Bend'r-Mahk was still in its early stages, you see, and the Legion rightfully feared that conflict expanding to Dragonstar.

The Direnni in Balfiera have sent one of their own to Angturiel. We've received no correspondence and this agent, Ciirarril Direnni, has made no attempt to make contact. Although the Direnni have some legal claim to their clan's fortresses in the Reach, in practicality they are sites of great archaeological value to us. I want you to ascertain the meaning of Ciirarril Direnni's presence here in the Reach, and whether this will affect our scholarly inquiries. Take this key. You might find a use for it.

The bounty states that we want him dead or alive, but I'm not holding my breath waiting to see him brought in. A man who's been hiding in those caves for years isn't going to come up here peacefully. The reward will be more than worth the effort.

The fertile fields of the Lorchwuir Heath are bordered by mesas to the west, the Vorndgad Forest to the north, and the Sundered Hills to the east. Sprawling Karthwasten lies at the center of the region. Vorngyd's Stand, the border outpost, can be found to the southwest. Local farms produce much of the Reach's food, while the excess is sold to caravans or skiffs headed down the Karth River.

The surrounding region is less claustrophobic than the Vorndgad Forest, but hardly less dangerous. Bandits lie in ambush to attack rich, unprepared caravans on the way here, while wild beasts and unmentionables roam the low fields and skulk in their caves. Further afield still, atop the rocky mesas in the distance, Reachmen make their camps, shunned by everyone except their own kind.

Now that I can restart my work on the fine intricacies of effective Invisibility, I need you to run errandgirl. How much do you know about Reachmen and their use of magicka? They're known to specialise in all kinds of curses and hedge-magick, but living off the land, some of them are great alchemists, too. Getting access to their mixes is nigh-impossible, but Aynoc, the healer at Haimtir's Great Hallowhall owes me a favour. I want you to visit her and ask for a Reachman alchemy sample.

I'm running some research into the alchemical creation of potions of invisibility. Or rather, I was.

I can supply the void salts, but I'm afraid I'll need you to collect five shadowfly stalks, a sample of spider silk, and a piece of quicksilver ore. If we do this properly, we may be able to release those ghosts from the Penumbra's hold over them.

As I said, I need you to find some trace or description of the creator's alchemical solution before I can attempt to penetrate the Penumbra's encasement. This is dangerous shadow magic, and I can't proceed responsibly without this information.
###

Yes, this is a strange item indeed. I've never seen anything like it. The Penumbra is clearly magical, yet I can discern no known spell or enchantment from examining its surface. Such are the mysteries of shadow magic. I believe we must dissolve the Penumbra's protective carapace if we are to discover its secrets.

> INFO.NAME alduin 2351268642698310878
It is Alduin who defines the length of the kalpa, and thus he is universally revered by the Nords. He is rarely invoked outside of the Dragon Cult, however, since the Nords prefer not to disturb their sleeping destroyer god -- indeed, much of the mythic cycle is concerned with the efforts of gods and mortals alike to prevent his awakening.
###

> INFO.NAME alduin 3242376131794918119
Alduin is the World-Eater itself, the Nordic god of finitude, destruction and rebirth. Although there have been many permutations of his nature in Nordic thought, Alduin has always been portrayed as the most powerful and implacable god in existence -- far more a force of nature than anthropomorphic being.

Because the Empire is finished pretending to be neutral. Uriel Septim VII is old, and he wants these lingering conflicts from the Simulacrum settled. Dragonstar is an embarassing reminder that the Empire is still not at peace, even all these years after Jagar Tharn's defeat.

How can you ask me to open my Guildhall to the throne-city of the very warlord who sacked the Dragonstar Fighters Guild and burnt half the Reach? To open my Guildhall to cities ruled by Nords, while a Redguard prince holds court in the adjacent building? It simply cannot be done, especially without approval from the Imperial agents in the border wall.

How do you judge a job, decide if it's too tough for you? Good question. Me, I check three things: location, opposition, and payoff. First, if it's a long walk, I worry.

Carriage service goes to Beorinhal, Karthwasten, and Markarth Side. If you're looking for thrills, head for the Arena. It's on the south end of town, down by the abandoned Fighters Guild hall.

Head west of it to find the Guild of Fighters. The Imperial Cult Chapel stands by the north gate, as does the Guild of Mages. Beyond the walls, there's a dock on the Karth River and carriage service can take you to Dragonstar East, Markarth Side, and Beorinhal. Rolic Gilded-Shield's manor is to the east, near a ravine.

I suppose there are. Fine. If you can get Jarl Jona and Prince Alak'tol to both agree to this madness, I will permit the Mages Guild to restore the guild guide connection. Good luck.

I cannot continue to argue with this barrage of bad faith half-truths and incidental contradictions. But you should know that you present a ridiculous line of reasoning. Go ask the Crown guards outside if their city is a part of Skyrim. Perhaps their answer will be more convincing than mine.
###

So it's a grey area. But it is nice to be a friend of the Guild, wouldn't you say?

You'll allow the guild guide link to be re-established, or I'll go to the castle and tell Jona that you're plotting with the Crowns.

What? I... That is a technicality, nothing more. Nords rule in Skyrim, and Skyrim rules Nords. It's quite presumptuous of you to question a Census and Excise Officer's understanding of the law. Besides, Dragonstar was always ruled from Karthwasten when the cities were ruled by Redguards.
###

> INFO.BNAM treaty of chorrol 20216323072693629872 c1
Then all of Dragonstar is a part of County Karthwasten, which was ceded to Skyrim by the Treaty.
###

Dry history, I'm afraid. But the wall is here to stay.
###

> INFO.NAME treaty of chorrol 2686117541253528715
Come to think of it, the Treaty didn't actually say anything about Dragonstar, but that doesn't matter. The Taurus Hall Concordat settled its status, dividing the city between the Crown Redguards in the west and the Dragonstar Nords in the east. And so it has stood to this day.
###

> INFO.BNAM treaty of chorrol 2686117541253528715 c1
But if the Treaty ignored Dragonstar, and the Concordat never specifically mentioned Skyrim or its Kingdoms, then by what right does the Reach rule Dragonstar East?

The Treaty of Chorrol was signed in 3E 399 by all sides at the end of the War of the Bend'r-Mahk. It established County Karthwasten from Karthwasten and its territories, and ceded that County to the Kingdom of the Reach. Additionally, it confirmed the permanent rule of Nordic Jarls in the High Rock city of Jehanna and the Hammerfell city of Elinhir.

Your target is the vault within the Lower Dungeon of Dragonstar Castle. Find it, pick the lock, and take what you can alongside the orichalc blade. Once you get back I'll smuggle it out of Dragonstar until the heat dies down. After that, you'll be rich, I'll be rich, that little Toad Cael will be rich, and there will be plenty more jobs coming in from Ilera and the Crowns.

I haven't seen him around, but if you run into Cael, tell him he can hang onto the armor after all. So you'll have to sweet talk your way inside -- make sure those guards like you before they've even talked to you -- or use invisibility to sneak past them.

Shadow magic is unpredictable, and demands a high price for its use. It may be that Asuul thought to use the village's imminent destruction to fuel the Umbra'Keth.

Yes, this is what happened. Just yesterday, I saw an old friend of mine enter the city. I really wanted to talk to him, but I was too embarrassed to approach him. I wasn't sure he would even recognize me in my current state. I wasn't always a beggar you know. But now, I regret not talking to him. He must be staying at a tavern somewhere in the city, but they don't let beggars like me in. Would you find him and convince him to meet me here, so we can talk? You can tell him I sent you.

This is where you come in. We have a proposal for the Thieves Guild. The Crown Prince would like to hire the Guild to steal Tangra right out from under Dalach. You would be compensated handsomely, and earn the favor of the Crown Prince, as well as our assistance in rooting out anything left of Dalach's gang.

We broke Razin. He has confessed everything. He was the spy. He was sent here to ensure that we did not suspect this "Dalach's" plan: to steal the orichalc blade, Tangra, that is currently in transport to Jarl Jona's castle, across the wall in Dragonstar East. This weapon is akin to a holy relic for the Redguard people. Razin was intended to present a ransom to us, once Dalach had the weapon. The requested sum was, of course, ridiculous.

I am inclined to believe Eugien and Anisin, since we have been aware of their relationship almost as long as they have. Earlier, possibly. So I believe that Eugien could not have planted the note, and the only reason I imagine Razin would lie is if he himself is the spy. A clever double-bluff, planting the note on himself for us to find. We will take Razin for interrogation. He will break, and we will learn what this Dalach is planning. This will, however, take time. Return to me tomorrow.
###

A note hidden in Razin's room? Let me read it. Hmm... I see. This is not looking good for Eugien, though that may be the intended purpose of the note. Confront Eugien, see what he has to say for himself, whether he planted the note in Razin's room. Don't worry about him trying to flee, I will have the guards put the Palace on lockdown. No one in or out without express permission.
###

Last I heard, the map is in a locked chest somewhere on the ground floor of the City Barracks, assuming you're entering from the main road. Find it, take it to our forger Erald Ambiste at the Karthwasten docks, and then place his modified map back where you found the original. One more thing -- you must avoid being seen while taking the map. We don't want to raise any suspicions.
###

You look like you need a history lesson. When the Nords took over Karthwasten during the War of Bend'r-Mahk, some Redguard went underground, literally, to prepare for an eventual uprising. We've had a mutually-beneficial relationship with them ever since we too were forced into these tunnels. They get goods and information, we get regular work. That could change, however, if the guards figure out that map.

I regret that I must deny these emissaries passage through the Dragonstar wall. At such a delicate time as this, I must enforce the fragile peace as carefully as ever. Prince Alak'tol has made it clear that he will not accept delegations from Orsinium into the western city. To allow these emissaries to pass would inflame the already tense state of affairs. And given Orsinium's... unique political situation, I am not legally able to override the Crowns' wishes, even for a diplomatic mission.

He commands the city's guards. You can find him at the City Barracks, no doubt plotting to make life hard for our guild. He's a brutish, violent man. You be careful around him, %PCRank.
