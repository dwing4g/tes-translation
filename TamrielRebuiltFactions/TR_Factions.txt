Former Mouth Eldale, of Altmer descent, was elevated to Councilor to replace the Mage Lord Darythi, Tower of Tel Narrusa, Helnim. This concludes several years of deliberation by the council.<BR>
<BR>
In response to repeated protests from Duke Dren and representatives of the other Great Houses, Telvanni Council reminded them that, according to ancient law and custom, Telvanni Council places no constraint on the ambitions and enterprise of its individual members. If the Empire or other House Councils wish to dispute Telvanni exploration and colonization of the wastes and wildernesses of Vvardenfell, they are welcome to do so, with the Councilors' best wishes, but Telvanni Council will not contribute its resources or authority to such endeavors.<BR>
<BR>
The council renews its objection to proposals placed before Duke Dren and the Grand Council concerning slavery and slave trading in Vvardenfell District. The right to own and trade slaves is guaranteed by the terms of the Treaty of the Armistice, and Telvanni Council will not entertain any discussion of abridgements of those rights.<BR>
