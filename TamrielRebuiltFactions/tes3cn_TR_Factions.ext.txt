Former Mouth Eldale, of Altmer descent, was elevated to Councilor to replace the Mage Lord Darythi, Tower of Tel Narrusa, Helnim. This concludes several years of deliberation by the council.<BR>
<BR>
In response to repeated protests from Duke Dren and representatives of the other Great Houses, Telvanni Council reminded them that, according to ancient law and custom, Telvanni Council places no constraint on the ambitions and enterprise of its individual members. If the Empire or other House Councils wish to dispute Telvanni exploration and colonization of the wastes and wildernesses of Vvardenfell, they are welcome to do so, with the Councilors' best wishes, but Telvanni Council will not contribute its resources or authority to such endeavors.<BR>
<BR>
The council renews its objection to proposals placed before Duke Dren and the Grand Council concerning slavery and slave trading in Vvardenfell District. The right to own and trade slaves is guaranteed by the terms of the Treaty of the Armistice, and Telvanni Council will not entertain any discussion of abridgements of those rights.<BR>

The Four Tribes are the four tribes of Vvardenfell, the Urshilaku, the Ahemmusa, the Zainab, and the Erabenimsun, as well as the tribes of the mainland, the Ishanuran and the Obainat. When I have been named 'Nerevarine' by four Ashlander tribes, I will have passed the Fifth Trial, and should return to Nibani Maesa for further guidance.

I do not know the ways of wizards. I have heard they honor the tests of life and death, as we do. The ones who live, live a long time. The ones who die are forgotten. They are old, and strange, and terrible. I know little. But I am afraid. And that is my counsel to you. Be afraid. It is no time to be bold and careless. It is no time to hoard your treasures. With wizards, there are no second chances.
我不知道巫师们的做法。我听说他们和我们一样尊重生死考验 活着的人可以活很久 死了的就会被遗忘 他们古老、奇怪、可怕 我知之甚少 但我害怕 这就是我给你们的忠告 恐惧吧 现在不是胆大妄为的时候。不是囤积财宝的时候 对巫师来说，没有第二次机会 {咨询}

In times of great danger, the Ashlander tribes unite under a single war leader. If you can prove to four tribes that you are the Nerevarine, and that the tribes must unite against the threat of the Sixth House, then each ashkhan will declare you 'Nerevarine' and war leader of all tribes. You must go to all the tribal ashkhans, but go first to Sul-Matuul, who is your friend, and who will surely grant you the honor.
