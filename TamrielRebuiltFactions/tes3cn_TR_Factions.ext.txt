Council Affairs of Note<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT"><BR>
Dredging works along the Kanit River between Hla Rud and Andrethis have concluded, allowing larger barges passage and improving the flow of goods in western Narsis District.<BR>
<BR>
The council is closely monitoring the situation in the lower Aanthirin, and encourages all law-abiding citizens to be watchful and report any suspicious activity near plantations and trade infrastructure to the nearest Hlaalu or Imperial Legion garrison.<BR>
<BR>
Director Cyrtumir of the Hlaalu Council Company is pleased to report that the company's newest office in Firsthold, Province of Summerset Isles, is performing above expectations, and that company trade in the Sea of Mists has doubled in the last decade.<BR>
<BR>
The council is pleased to report that the port of Bal Foyen continues to thrive, but has been concerned with the rise in reports of criminality (outlander in origin) within Bal Foyen's poorer districts. Councilman Tholer Andras has requested more guards to ensure that all residents are protected. Local merchants are also lending their resources so as to improve local security.<BR>
<BR>
The council wishes to commend the River Watch, Canyon Watch, and all the local garrisons and patrols for greatly reducing the number of reported bandit and wildlife attacks throughout Shipal-Shin and the Coronati Basin.<BR>
<BR>
King Hlaalu Athyn Llethan, High Councilor and Lord of Morrowind, grants relief to merchants complaining of high tariffs on imported alcoholic beverages.<BR>
<BR>
The council is pleased to report a reduction in the incidence of theft and violent crime in the Hlaalu House Districts, thanks to the vigilance of the Legions and stern sentences by the magistrates. The council laments the unfortunate disturbances of the public peace resulting from the increasingly aggressive competition between the Thieves Guild and the Camonna Tong for control of the black markets.<BR>
<BR>
A minor tax revolt in Balmora was suppressed without undue harm to life and property. The council sent deputations to the Duke to express their concerns over the high tax rates and the injurious effect of high tariffs on trade.<BR>

Former Mouth Eldale, of Altmer descent, was elevated to Councilor to replace the Mage Lord Darythi, Tower of Tel Narrusa, Helnim. This concludes several years of deliberation by the council.<BR>
<BR>
In response to repeated protests from Duke Dren and representatives of the other Great Houses, Telvanni Council reminded them that, according to ancient law and custom, Telvanni Council places no constraint on the ambitions and enterprise of its individual members. If the Empire or other House Councils wish to dispute Telvanni exploration and colonization of the wastes and wildernesses of Vvardenfell, they are welcome to do so, with the Councilors' best wishes, but Telvanni Council will not contribute its resources or authority to such endeavors.<BR>
<BR>
The council renews its objection to proposals placed before Duke Dren and the Grand Council concerning slavery and slave trading in Vvardenfell District. The right to own and trade slaves is guaranteed by the terms of the Treaty of the Armistice, and Telvanni Council will not entertain any discussion of abridgements of those rights.<BR>

There's no convenient way to get there. I must also warn you. Mistress Faruna is reclusive and takes little interest in such matters.
